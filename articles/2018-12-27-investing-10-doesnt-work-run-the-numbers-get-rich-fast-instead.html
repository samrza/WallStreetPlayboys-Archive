<p>One common recommendation from personal finance “experts” is to save 10% of your income. Unfortunately this advice is absolutely awful and will make sure that you’re extremely far behind over a 30-40 year time frame. Why? Well the numbers only work if you expect to make the same or less as you get older. We’ll use the power of compounding and factual math to prove this out. To avoid any sort of debate over investing returns, inflation etc. we will use 5% returns. This means the 5% gains encapsulate inflation already so it’s an aggressive number (5% returns guaranteed for 39 years straight). </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Saving 10% Works If We Assume No Lifestyle Improvement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Save 10% – No Income
Change: </strong>In this first example what we will do is assume that a person earns
$50,000 per year. We will assume that they save 10% of their gross income
($5,000) per year for 39 years straight. At this point they should be at a nice
retirement age of 60. The second assumption we make is 5% returns on that money
for life. Anyone who has been through the last 20 years of stock market
volatility knows this won’t be perfect. But. We want to make the picture as
clear as possible. So we’re sticking with it. </p>
<p><strong>What happens?  </strong>In the first example, the math is
extremely easy to run. What you see is that you save $5K a year, you spend $45K
a year and your $5K annual contribution compounds at 5%. At the end of the 40
year run (39 years of compounding) you have $604,000. But… There is a problem
here. The problem is that the spending number is actually $45,000 which means
you have a multiple of just 13.4x. Since we know you need about 20x your living
expenses to retire, you’re short $296,000. So despite saving 10% of your income
from 21 years of age to 60… you’re not able to quit. You’d have to work until
you’re 68 years old to pass the 20x number. </p>
<p>Wait what about social security and other inheritances… this could help fix the situation. While it is possible to make up the difference with social security and other one-time inheritances you *might* be able to pull it off. That said… Who wants to work for 40 years and live with a “might be fine” scenario. Not us and likely none of our readers. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191229073435/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/when-does-the-snowball-effect-occur-short-musings-on-momentum/">The Power Of Compounding</a>: </strong>If you wondered why Trust Fund babies don’t have anything to worry about… look no further than the power of compounding. If someone invested $90,085 in year 1 (2019 in this example) they would have exactly $604,000 as well. Instead of being shocked by this, it helps explain why having a career in sales or having a one-time *event* is so critical to becoming rich. The entire goal is to invest a lump sum as early as possible and forget about it so you don’t have to worry about saving money in the future (easier said than done of course!). </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Saving 10% With Lifestyle Improvement is Actually Worse</strong></p>
<p><strong>Save 10% – Grow Wage:
</strong>In this example we’ll do the exact same math. But. We will assume that your
wage actually increases over time. We have to keep the comparisons equal so
remember our assumptions: 1) market returns of 7% which means an actual return
of 5% after inflation eats 2%, 2) we assume you save 10% of your income and now
3) the new assumption is your wage grows at 4%, which is the average, or just
2% after inflation. In summary, your investment return in 5% (7% actual – 2%
inflation) and your wage growth is 2% (4% actual – 2% inflation). </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4133" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20191229073435im_/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Pew.png" srcset="https://web.archive.org/web/20191229073435im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Pew.png 657w, https://web.archive.org/web/20191229073435im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Pew-300x182.png 300w"/></figure>
<p><strong>What happens?  </strong>In this example the math is a bit more
complicated but here are the numbers. By age 60 you’re making $108,000 per year
and you have $805,325 to your name. Since you’re saving 10% it means your
annual spending in the year 2058 is $97,413/year.  When we apply that number through it means
you have 8.3x your annual spending saved up. Wait a minute. This is a
significantly lower number than the 13.4x you had when your wage was simply
flat lined. <em>The reason for this is
that investment gains are outpacing your ability to earn.</em> This has been
the case for the average person for quite some time and also explains why the
rich get richer while the poor get poorer over time. </p>
<p><strong>The Problem: </strong>There
are two common rebuttals with this math, first we assume the person cannot
downgrade his lifestyle. This is entirely true and perhaps the person is
slightly better off (meaning he could live on less). The problem? Well if we
assume he can live on $60,000 instead of $97,000… this still leaves you with
just 13.4x (essentially equal to the first example with a decrease in
lifestyle). Nothing amazing.</p>
<p>The second rebuttal is that you’d save more as a percentage
over time. This is true and is a legitimate debate point. The one wrinkle we’d
throw in… we assume the person never had a set-back for a single year. Also. At
age 40 earnings usually peak and it is unlikely to grow earnings from 40 to 60
at the exact same rate as from age 21-40. For fun… think about this insane stat…
if this same person took a single year off (say at age 40) and actually lost
money as he was unemployed (-$28,000) he would only have $675,000 at age 60 (***$130,000***
difference!!!!)</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Too Much Math What is the Point</strong></p>
<p><strong>51% is Significant Acceleration: </strong>If you’re able to *invest* more than 50% of your income, even 51%, you’re seeing significant gains in your net worth of time. This is because you will not only put away a year of income, but more importantly, it means your standard of living is being forced upward without additional income. If long-term price appreciation (market return, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191229073435/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/how-to-make-millions-with-other-peoples-money/">real estate etc.</a>) outpace your ability to earn… Eventually the switch will flip where your assets earn significantly more than your active income. This is an amazing cross over point and extremely difficult to achieve. But. If you put away over 50% it is a mathematical possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Time Value of Money is *Serious*: </strong>If we assume you are happy with your lifestyle but you’re only saving 10% of your income… Now lets say one year you sell a business you were working on. It is sold for 10x your annual income. Boom an *event*. Assuming you do not spend the proceeds… you never have to worry about finances again. Why? Your savings just increased by a factor of 100x. Most people think their savings rate was only 92% versus 10% which doesn’t sound like much… This is not how you do the math. If you were saving $5K off of $50K a year, you incur an event at $500K, you just saved $500K/$5K = 100 years of savings in a single day. Make no mistake, most people who actually become rich have an <strong>*event*</strong> that makes their cash flow change for the rest of their lives. The reality is that you get rich in a windfall or by grinding out a large amount money over a <strong><em>*short*</em></strong> period of time.</p>
<p>We made this point in the first section. If the average person saves 10% for life (next to no one ever does), you’re better off receiving $100,000 at age 21 and leaving it invested for 40 years. You’ll have more money than they will by the time they retire. This is why money, like every other game in life, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191229073435/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/the-five-rigged-games-in-life/">is rigged for the top</a>. Actually… if you could earn an average income and somehow live for free (only 3-4 years) you’d be better off than saving 10% for 40 years. That’s how powerful compounding is. </p>
<p><strong>Assets Have Been on a
Tear: </strong>We have no real solution here. For some reason assets have continued
to outpace wage growth for decades. This is unlikely going to change with
automation, robots, artificial intelligence and more. The answer is to try and
get as much money as you can up front and fast. Then you can build up that
asset base faster than the general population and get well ahead of the
eventual long-term climb in assets. To make sure we’re clear, we’re not
positive on the macroeconomic climate over the next 2 years (so no change) but
if you ask us about the next 30-40 years then we are certainly positive on
future growth. </p>
<p><strong>Increase Your Investment Rate Early: </strong>There was an overlooked comment from an anonymous person this week so we’ll share it below. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191229073435/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/2018-investment-banking-compensation-and-qa-announcement/#comment-79024">Here is the link as well </a>since we want to give credit where it is due. </p>
<p><em>“Want to share advice
I wish I had to all the college students reading this. When you are earning
income from a job, especially when it’s below 300k, comp numbers that seem very
close on paper can be extremely different in terms of life impact.</em></p>
<p><em>In NYC most people
spend about 100k pre-tax (60k post-tax) to live even as an analyst. This means
that a 150k compensation will lead to 50k pre-tax in savings but a 200k
compensation will lead to 100k savings. The amount saved in a year increased
100% despite income only going up 33%. This means a person working one year at
200k will save as much as a person working two years at 150k. It’s nuts. You
even see this effect between 200k and 300k, it’s a 50% increase in comp but a
100% increase in savings (100k pre-tax vs 200k pre-tax).</em></p>
<p><em>This is why it’s so important
to _maximize_ the income you are earning out of school. 100k is not enough as
stated on this blog, you need to think of job income in two parts: (1) living
and (2) savings. You also need to think of income in terms of _cash flow_
instead of just the dollar amount in the offer. If you have two offers:  <strong>1)
Offer:</strong> 120k base + 50k annual bonus (~5k 6 mo stub bonus) + 0k signing; <strong>2. Offer:</strong> 110k base + 45k/yr in equity
vesting monthly over 4 years + 20k sign on.</em></p>
<p><em>#1 is a higher offer
but #2 has much better cash flow. You can invest/use that 20k the day you start
and will get investable equity every month. With #2 you will need to wait 18
months to cash in that 50k bonus and will be living off the base in the meantime.
You can and need to _negotiate_ option 1 so that they offer a signing bonus.
Even if it’s only 10k (half of #2) that up front cash will be incredibly useful
out of college. Also, very few people negotiate for one-time aspects of comp
(signing bonus, relo bonus), take advantage of that…. Much more can be said but
those two points are key when picking offers.”</em></p>
<p>This is a fantastic summary. If you’re looking for one sentence it is this. When you’re in your 20s and even early 30s try to stack a ton of money up front as it will snowball you forward for the rest of your life. Most people try to play catch up and as you can see from our second example… one slip up and suddenly it’s a cliff not a hill that you must climb. </p>
<p><strong>Don’t Waste Your Youth: </strong>The main point? If you waste your 20s you’re going to be climbing up a slippery mountain with jagged edges. If you waste time, you could be in an extremely deep hole for the rest of your life. Sounds daunting because it is. Look around and find the guys who tried to get it “together” at thirty and you’ll see they never quite get there. They are forced to scale back their living standards and options. You want your options to <em><u>increase</u></em> and your time to become <u><em>more valuable</em></u>, this is only possible if you don’t waste your youth. </p>

<p>This makes more question myself pretty hard as I try to choose between 3 offers:</p>
<p>– Sales at Google for 25/hr no commision but the resume experience will get me anywhere</p>
<p>– Sales at a real estate leads company that commissions average 5k-20k a month with 30k base.</p>
<p>– Sales at a strong cyber security SAAS company that will lead to a clear path in Enterprise SAAS AE roles.</p>
<p>I know to choose whatever takes up the least time and pays the most but sometimes it’s a guessing game.</p>

<p>My other option is doing a training program form company called Tech Qualled that trains military veterans for 7 weeks online then 3 days in person on how to be an outside account executive and lines them up with an outside account executive job at a SAAS company. 10% acceptance rate in the program and have to pass many IQ and EQ tests.</p>

<p>Really liked the article. I have lived my life consistent with this. I am in my early 30’s was worth about 2M a as of a few weeks ago and now worth 1.8Mish due to the markets. My NW is really just the component of aggressive (60% plus savings of after-tax income) saving for the decade I have been out of school. My income hasn’t been so crazy for NYC standards either, but I received a one-timer of $500K (work related) through work that has accelerated everything. I am married and want to have a family in the NY area so I certainly won’t be able to “get out” early despite the resources I have, but imagine I will have a solid amount of flexibikity moving forward that I wouldn’t have had if I wasn’t so aggressive with my savings. Instead of hanging it up early like I always thought I would, it appears I will likely go down the more  “family lifestyle” route and indulge more, but not feel like I’m squeezing myself or too extended simply bc of my cushion that I have accumulated over the first 10 years of my working life.</p>

<p>Thanks for the insightful post. I’m 26 and working for a Real Estate developer<br/>
in the Southeast making about $100k all-in with no carry. My goal is get the skills and network needed to go off on my own and make some real money. The problem is that it will take 5+ years (and that’s optimistic) to get to that point. The more I read your site, the more I realize I need to accelerate my earnings and cash flow as soon as possible. </p>
<p>I’ve spent countless hours researching and thinking of “the right idea” for an ecommerce business, but can’t seem to find the right one. It would be extremely helpful if you could do a post  on idea generation for products. I know you’re not handing out business ideas for free, but it would be really helpful to see your process.</p>
<p>Appreciate all the great posts over the years.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>It took me just shy of 4 Months (not typical) – average wait time is 6-9 months for top performers and 12+ for those who get taken advantage of. Every company is a little different, but in my opinion, if you’re still a BDR after 12 months, they’ve evaluated you and made their decision without vocalizing it to you. If you’re interested – WallStreet Playboys has already published an article outlining Enterprise Software Sales. That article has been 100% accurate for me thus far.</p>
<p>Whatever company you’re in, don’t let yourself get taken advantage of. I would recommend a smaller / med size business where separation from top management is small. The Oracles, SalesForces and other brand name software companies usually have an 18 Month wait period before they’ll consider moving you to inside sales – this is completely unnecessary. If you can sell the product of a company few people have heard of and have the numbers, W2 and track record to prove it – you can literally go anywhere.</p>
<p>As a BDR you need to identify who could potentially be your next boss and go to lunch with them and “pick their brain”. When they give you advice, regardless of how accurate or inaccurate it is – follow-up with them and say “Hey, thanks for the advice on XYZ, it really helped me do XYZ”.</p>
<p>Often times people fail to realize that the most important deal you’ll ever close is getting yourself promoted as fast as humanly possible.</p>
<p>I’ve crossed the 2-Year mark as a quota carrier and I’m well on my way to an enterprise role in the next couple months as the typical beginning of the year corporate shake-ups take place.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you my friend, the highs and lows of this business can be taxing at times, but when you’ve achieved your end of year goal and are closing deals in your accelerators it’ll all be worth it.</p>
<p>Oh – last piece of advice I don’t think was covered in the WallStreet Playboy Article, but should be somewhat obvious. It’s fine to go to the bars when you’re trying to get promoted and have a couple drinks when you’re trying to make friends with the Sales Directors etc., but know your place and don’t make it a habit. After you get promoted let your numbers speak for yourself and don’t waste your nights drinking $5 happy hour drinks with guys stuck in middle-management roles making tons of money, but saving nothing. It can be a crab pot out there meaning as you try to escape, people will try to pull you down.</p>

<p>Wow…just wow. Stumbled across your website very recently and read quite a few of your articles and this is exactly what I did. So my back story, I’m 31 years old and I have 72 million dollars to my name, did this by investing really really young(started at 16) and grinding as fuck during my early 20s saving as much as possible to put into my portfolio(even did some illegal shit in college to get some money haha, stupid me, but hey I was young and I really wanted the money). I was very lucky I had about 78 grand right out of high school and then the crash of 08 hit. Perfect opportunity and I bought so many stocks at dirt cheap prices(particularly in Asian markets), I’m a value investor so I buy stocks which are undervalued base on my valuation metrics, and right after 08, so many stocks were operating at 0.5-1% of it’s liquidation price, which was a fucking steal. Horded all these stocks in 08, kept pumping more money into my portfolio throughout my 20s. Within 4-5 years about 2/3 of these stocks went to/past it’s liquidation price which made me a shitload of money.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, I’m now an angel investor, investing in a few startups from asia(particularly Indonesia), some of which already blew up and brought me a 10x gain. I was really lucky that I was taught these principles since I was young, to grind as hard as possible as young and to INVEST EARLY so I didn’t make the same mistake as my father did(he was a plumber and we grew up really poor living off the government most of the time, by his late 40s he was at a constant self development phase teaching me everything he knew about stocks, social skills and etc to me, thank god for that).</p>
<p>Really awesome to see information like this being shared among young people(I assume so from the comment section of your blogs), this was the exact same info my father gave me which I never will forget and always be thankful for. Keep it up wall street playboys! Love from Australia!!!</p>
