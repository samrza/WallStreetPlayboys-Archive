They didn’t mean to spread lies, but good intentions do not change the facts. I always got good grades in college and high school and did what my teachers and parents asked me to do and didn’t complain. Yet I was $35k in student debt and living with my parents after my ‘help the world’ attempt in the Peace Corps (literally one of the things this blog warns against). Sure I had “helped the world” but I was now incredibly unhappy and mostly felt like a loser and was definitely not helping the world. I was further demoralized when I found that my $40k/year undergrad degree was not helpful at all in landing me gainful employment in my chosen college major–teaching and coaching high school–since those jobs were scarce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wish I’d had a better framework for success at the time (would have gone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916004655/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/enterprise-sales-a-legitimate-career-to-get-rich/">right into tech sales</a>), but I at least had the sense that my current situation was a dead end.  When I decided never to teach high school again, my parents and friends freaked and that was the beginning of me doing what felt like going against the grain (aka the masses).</p>
<p dir="ltr">I knew I needed a change but I didn’t know what. So I moved to a world class city, got a job at a top 10 restaurant, and proceeded to work and party. Leaving a shift every night with a fistful of cash, booze and women around was a recipe for hedonism and soon after, I found myself in credit card debt and unable to even pay my tax returns. The no-interest credit cards I’d taken out started charging interest and that made a bad thing worse. I turned 28 and had no 401k, and nothing to show for the life I’d led except a pile of debt.  I had a moment of reflection when I asked one of the cooks at my restaurant (guy was 34) about his 401k and he chuckled and looked at me like I was nuts. Why would he save money? How would he buy beers after his shift?</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was tough at the time but I had to look myself in the mirror (final straw was a basketball game that dislocated my finger and I had no health insurance) and recognized <em>“I am no better than that cook, and if I continue down this path I will end up just like him.”</em> It was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916004655/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/everything-comes-down-to-ego-feed-it-to-get-what-you-want/">blow to my ego</a> but one that I needed to accept.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For me, the problem wasn’t working hard or having the energy to work. I’ve always been a go-getter and willing to learn, even though I’m not the fastest learner. The problem was I had the wrong mentality. I wasn’t channeling my energy into something substantial or building a client base. I was working hourly. Right around that soul-searching time there were three key mindset shifts that (finally!) occurred to me to put into action, thanks in part to stumbling onto this blog: <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Your 20s are for working your ass off:</span></em> They are not for partying your ass off 4-5 nights a week like I was doing. Your energy declines around age 30 so you had better set future you up for success. Nothing wrong with partying per say, but ideally you are combining it with work. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) You *must* make more than an hourly wage:</span></em> If you are ever going to be rich you need to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916004655/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-choosing-a-career/">paid on performance</a> not time for money exchanges. You must have a product or a client base to sell to. This is non-negociable. Even a consultant making $100/hour will be spinning their wheels if the end goal is early retirement. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) Most people don’t take action:</span> </em>Most people over-research and don’t just dive in, even most smart people. They’ll ask a million questions but they won’t take a risk and try a new job or endeavor, because if they fail that would deflate their ego.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With these realizations, I needed to put them into action ASAP. Luckily I was in a top tier city and I was able to get a job at a technology sales company no problem by charming my manager and talking about all the good things I did with the kids in the Peace Corps (hey at least it got me something). These jobs aren’t that hard to get and starting salary was shit, but the commission was rife with potential… Six months after making it off the ‘starter’ floor I looked at the guy in the desk next to me and he was also 34 years old like the cook at the restaurant. But when I asked him about his 401k, instead of laughing he offered to take fifteen minutes and work through the math of how he wanted to retire at age 45. He was the first literal millionaire I’d met. This was obviously a stark contrast with the cook, but then again most of the masses don’t give much of a thought to their 401k and many live paycheck to paycheck, convincing themselves that “money is the root of all evil.” This is of course a way of protecting their ego from recognizing their own laziness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I spent a lot of late nights the first year at the company while not really even making that much money, but it earned the respect of a lot of the other sales guys that I was in this to learn and was willing to put in the work. When they saw I was legit they took me under their wing and were as open as could be with all of their tips. Not only did they advise me in matters of my job, but I also soaked up their perspectives on savings, 401k etc, even life and time management. For example I will never wait in a line again for food longer than 5 minutes (pretty sure I read that on the twitter feed of this blog). I will pre-plan my day better than that. If you wait in a line for a half hour you are saying your time is worth less than $30 an hour if that food costs you $15.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I did my best to mirror what the upper tier sales guys were doing and make it my own style, and eventually was able to develop my own way of closing deals. I have a much more laid back personality, so the aggressiveness and frankness necessary for sales was not natural to me. After a while I got the hang of it by simply not giving up and reading a few books. As far as numbers go at year 1 I was at around $35k, year 2 $50k, year 4 $60k+.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At about year one into the job I kicked my side business into a higher gear. I quickly realized that with a few simple changes in my day I could put in <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least 2-3 hours of work into the side business without even working before or after work hours</span></em>. My commute was about 30 minutes each way, so that hour turned into the time I would personally message clients and gain rapport. Many were shocked that I was taking the time to do so. It also gave me a sense of accomplishment rather than just staring out the window or playing candy crush like most of the masses during their work commute.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Secondly, I simply turned my work downtime into time for my side business. This was especially useful during slow seasons and holidays. While other employees were complaining about ‘how slow it was’ and how they ‘had nothing to do,’ I would simply nod my head in agreement and slip my noise canceling headphones over my ears to tune them out while I worked like a dog on my side business (as this blog has stated many times <em>“Smile, nod and agree”</em>). As I became more efficient at my job and handling my client base, I was able to do more work for the side biz while I was at work. I’m pretty sure at this point companies don’t expect a full 100% output from their employees anymore, given all of the distractions for the masses (smartphones, fantasy, dating apps, etc) so just do the opposite and work on something long term while everyone else is checking their losing fantasy football team’s stats every ten minutes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another key factor in all this was that by the 2 year mark of working in tech sales, I was making enough money that I was able to take a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916004655/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/is-starting-a-company-the-least-risky-option-to-get-rich/">risk on spending big for some ads for the side biz</a>. Those paid off big time. People have asked me about choosing a niche and as far as that goes, Efficiency explains better than I can with many ideas for a product. The key is to get started and fail two or ten times, however many it takes. Failure is not a bad thing this is literally part of the process for finding your niche.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, in my 30s I am not “rich” but I am not living paycheck to paycheck. I am on the brink of quitting my job as the side business is doing very well and I need to capture the momentum, which will require full time attention. It is not an easy gig but it is product and client based, skills I developed during my time in sales. Next year I am forecasting 150-200k gross, plus the gains are passive since it is product based so I will build on top of that the following year. When it comes to choosing a niche, some passive product income is necessary if you want to get rich.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I also feel very happy that if need be I can always fall back on technology sales since it is a high need area. I would definitely look to do enterprise sales as instructed in this blog. Wish I had done that at age 21 or 22 (you can get into tech sales with an associate’s degree). If you are in a job and you are not sure about quitting or trying something else my suggestion is to look at the guy who is one rung on the ladder or so ahead of you and ask yourself <em>“Is this who I want to be <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_391533949" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">in five years</span></span>?”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">In my case I decided I didn’t want to be working in a restaurant with no savings <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_391533950" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">in five years</span></span> hooking up with 6’s. Looking back it is clear as day that I made the right decision but in the moment there was a certain inertia keeping me from pulling the trigger on trying something new. If I hadn’t dislocated my finger and had the issue pushed, who knows I might have stuck around for a few more years.  Most people react to their environment and not vice versa but you can be different if you choose. It just takes some guts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I recently went back to the restaurant I worked at and, without prompting, the few people who I knew from my time there came up to me and gave a laundry list of reasons why they were still working at a restaurant. I didn’t ask them what they were up to. It wasn’t even on my mind to be honest. But they felt the need to defend their choice to remain in a dead-end situation. This was a red flag they had something else on their mind they should be doing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is indeed the greatest time in history to be alive, and all the negativity we are bombarded with is shocking. Nod, play dumb when necessary, and do not waste time trying to change the minds of idiots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One question I’ve wondered about is why WSPs keep this blog? Like the writers of this blog, I am floored that more people don’t just do the things written here and get their life in order and flood the market. But as I become more successful, I have started being asked by a few people in real life “how did I do xyz”. I tell them, and often they nod with a glazed look and I know what they’re thinking: “But that sounds so hard. I could never do that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can do it but you won’t do it because of any rah-rah motivational post.  Work on being a producer not a consumer on your down time and you will be surprised how far you can go. And read Efficiency – I wish I had read this book at age 18.</p>

<p>We’ll be first to comment of course! First congratulations and you deserve all of the credit for changing your life! Online sales and regular sales have a lot in common and its good to see you made the transition in a smooth way. </p>
<p>The one thing we would note, you won’t be surprised… We wouldn’t outright quit. You never know when those ads stop working or when your monthly revenues go down (or up!) in a big way</p>
<p>If you follow the path in the end of the book that outlines how to maximize your career without quitting we’ll bet that you can keep your high performance and grow the business. As a rough outline, we’d say with your good position, you’d need to generate 3x online compared to what you earn at work. </p>
<p>You’re probably sick of helping someone else get rich, but look at around at the mediocre people and realize you can take your foot off the gas a little without giving up those guaranteed checks that will be spent on your online business.</p>
<p>We’ve been there and every time people try to quit at 1x or even 2x it ends up being unfortunate because you never know when a bad quarter or month comes around. Best keep both worlds.</p>
<p>Oh and btw we think you can do ~$300K easily based on your overview, we have an idea of what you’re doing already. Good Luck future millionaire!</p>

<p>Congrats on your profound life/career changes. It certainly sounds like you have a ton to be proud of and I hope that we have the opportunity to hear about your continued success in the coming years.<br/>
The challenge for me regarding the lack of a side hustle/biz is not capacity, but not sure if I frankly need it at this point. I work for a large company, but have meaningful equity (not close to majority) on a team (think partner in a law firm or wealth management or small biz etc) and make a healthy living. Early 30’s, saved nearly 2M and currently make mid 300ish a year with modest, yet sustainable growth going forward. With these numbers and my ability to save a meaningful % of my after tax income, I should have enough to hang it up in the next 10-15 years. I know I have the time/energy to start a side biz, yet haven’t due to complacentcy and laziness. Thanks for the great content as always.</p>

<p>Appreciate the response and that seems very logical. Outside of Efficiency, are there any other resources/books that you would suggest in terms of tools to evaluate existing websites. I have zero knowledge in that space and wouldn’t even begin to know where to start. I would even be willing to provide modest equity for ongoing advice/consulting if I were to move forward. Thanks for the feedback.</p>

<p>Awesome story man – keep going!! </p>
<p>Couple questions for you if you don’t mind: </p>
<p>1)</p>
<p>“It is not an easy gig but it is product and client based, skills I developed during my time in sales.”</p>
<p>Does this mean the side biz includes “human-to-human” interaction, in other words not all through a sale page but also requiring in-person sales? </p>
<p>2)</p>
<p>“People have asked me about choosing a niche and as far as that goes, Efficiency explains better than I can with many ideas for a product.”</p>
<p>Agreed Efficiency offers great niche ideas. Did you test demand for your products before launching. </p>
<p>Thanks again for sharing the story. Also makes for a GREAT testimonial to Efficiency.</p>

<p>Yes – indeed my gig does involve interfacing with clients face to face on occasion but moreso over the internet. I think this is a necessary step these days and the faceless ‘niche site’ businesses, while there are success stories, are harder to gain a foothold. The game has changed in the last few years. </p>
<p>Which leads into my answer to question number two. I did try a few niche sites for affiliate marketing, but I found personally that I wasn’t able to gain enough market share on those so I had to go another route. The important thing IMO is to be brave enough to reach out to potential clients and ask them to fill out a small survey. Ask them if they like xyz product in your potential niche, and then say you can give them a freebie and would you please give  feedback on it. Many of those people turned into (lifelong) customers.  </p>
<p>Testing is key! I highly recommend the book “The Lean Startup” to learn more about how to test.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember – your niche/product site needs traffic and HITS! How are you getting it in front of your customers? You need eyeballs. I think a lot of people just put the site up and pray for visitors. You have to be bold enough to reach out to people. You can do this on Facebook pretty easily. Just find people in a group with a shared interest and start reaching out to them. Fake if you have to, and don’t give up. You’ll get there.</p>

<p>Bought Efficiency and will buy The Lean Startup also. Great to hear your story. I am currently demand testing, with no SEO/ads/facbook/etc. Question is how to gauge what is good demand? Currently getting 1 “buy” a day (website 2 months old) and not sure if I should drop ~$10k to have the manufacturer make the product or not? At the current rate if would take ~3 years to move all the product. Net profit $5/item excluding taxes considerations.</p>

<p>lol. I see a lot of those products – total rip off. That’s why I love WSPs so much! They just give you the damn advice. Literally everything you need is covered in Efficiency. Most people want that magic solution. The solution is testing and failing a bunch.</p>

<p>It is absolutely transferable. For me I got decent enough at writing copy (Sales emails), and stroking the egos of people for the sale. </p>
<p>I also learned that most of my sales in the tech world were 90% relationship based. “I like you so I’ll spend my money with you.” That realization struck a chord with me and so I do a similar thing with my side biz. </p>
<p>WSPs book rec’s are on point for learning sales tactics on that as well. Ca$hvertising was probably the most immediately applicable.</p>

<p>Hey,<br/>
23 year old guy from Germany here. I’m proud to say that Wall Street Playboys was the biggest influence for me to start my entrepreneurial journey in 2014.</p>
<p>After failing on many, many internet businesses for 3 years straight, I couldn’t make meets end anymore, and I I needed to get a job/start a carreer. </p>
<p>Thats where luckily the Tech Sales post came out, which directly inspired me to take action. A day later I applied to around 30-40 tech companys as a SDR. To my surprise I did get many job offers of big tech companys, willing to pay me big bucks. The wages were equivalent to a wage of a doctor or lawyer here in Germany. </p>
<p>My family couldn’t believe this. My friends couldn’t believe this. I fucking couldn’t believe this.</p>
<p>Why couldn’t anybody believe this? Glad you asked!</p>
<p>I have a *TERRIBLE* resumee. </p>
<p>1) I barely did get a school education (3.8 is the cut off in Germany and I had 3.8)<br/>
2) No college degree (always thought college was inefficient)<br/>
3) No job experience (always had a distain for authority)<br/>
4) Was in a sort of “depression” after a break up with my 5yr long-term relationship and I  also was 5K in debt. </p>
<p>Lets put it this way: I had nothing going on for me and basically everybody thought that starbucks wouldn’t even hire me.</p>
<p>I proved them wrong.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Somehow I knew that people would hire me. </p>
<p>This sentence from Efficiency stuck in my head: “The product doesn’t matter (many products are comparable) what matters is how good you are at selling it. While this is an extreme view (certainly a terrible product is difficult to sell), if your product does what it says it will do… The secret sauce is in the sale.”</p>
<p>This is How I Sold Myself To Other Companys:</p>
<p>Basically, I spun my whole life story in a positive way and told the managers *exactly* what they wanted to hear.</p>
<p>I sold myself as a kid who always was making a bit of cash besides school and who always was looking for ways to make money (true). After finishing school, I said that I build up a small company via cold calling and could manage to live a more or less comfortable lifestyle doing this (made this completly up and just sold myself as an expert who already has experience).<br/>
After doing plenty of 80-100 hour work weeks and being at the point of scaling my business and hire my first employees, I felt like I was burned out and would rather enjoy to live a comfortable 40-60 hours work week (guess what, also lyin’ here… but I knew that they would ask *why* I now wanted to switch firms).</p>
<p>I was dressed to perfection, highly confident and positive in the interviews (feels natural to me, because I’m a Go-Lucky-Happy-Guy).</p>
<p>All managers told me that I’m exactly the sales guy they were looking for: charismatic, young, driven, who has expertise….</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe that this whole made up story was working out.</p>
<p>But after the interview process I thought to myself… why should I cold call to make some idiot rich, if I could cold call for my own company?</p>
<p>Long story short:</p>
<p>I reused one of my old websites which provide a “online service” on a monthly rebill. The target audience are rich people whom I can charge high prices compared to industry standards.</p>
<p>I made myself a deadline. If I couldn’t get the first client in 4 weeks, I would just start working for someone else.</p>
<p>A week later, I did get one ***VERY BIG*** client who I can rebill for at least the next 6 month. This client alone is covering my whole living exenses, including rent and everything. </p>
<p>By the way, the second cold call resulted in this opportunity. Unbelieveable luck. Guess after *thousands* of wasted hours trying to make money online… I made my own luck.</p>
<p>Now I’m in the best position of my life to scale this business and become a millionaire at age 25.</p>
<p>Thank you guys for making this possible.</p>
<p>P.S: If you want to read about my past failures:<br/>

<p>Those were for salary+ commissions. Yeah first year I started in like March so I think that was lowballing a little. I wanted to give exact numbers. Commission potential is higher – but base is lower at my company.</p>

<p>Hi Keanu, thanks for the post!</p>
<p>In my *former* area, there are alot of immigrant families that start restaurants because that’s the only skill they have when coming over, and many families run those restaurants for their entire lives. </p>
<p>There are many people who complain about being too tired, grinding day in and day out, and how every day seems to be the same with no momentum.</p>
<p>They don’t have many skills and don’t know how actual employment works in this country and therefore do the same thing their entire lives. I personally didn’t know tech sales was a career until 22, and I *accidentally* applied for a tech sales job at 21 (got lucky I guess). </p>
<p>It’s very interesting how breaking your finger took you down this path of discovery, because for me, it was much different. I was somewhat of a netizen and *felt* something was wrong, which led me here and other places for an atomic truth bomb. </p>
<p>I think there are many people like us that don’t know how to play the game of life(my family unfortunately), and would like to thank WSPs for giving us this information in a free and unfiltered way. </p>
<p>We are truly living in a great age, where we can find all the information we need at the click of a button. I know my parents and their parents didn’t have that luxury, and were left to make crippling mistakes on their own accord. </p>
<p>Congratulations on your success.</p>

<p>Incredible as always. Just what I needed to read as I prepare to expand my fitness business into product sales. The parts about people reacting to their environment (and not asserting their intentions), as well as people blindly rationalizing their position in life even when you don’t ask, are so spot on it almost made my gut turn.

<p>Great guest post.</p>
<p>I’m guessing a lot of readers, like myself, were given a lot of bad career and educational advice in their teens and twenties.</p>
<p>It’s good to read a post from someone in a similar position who wasn’t simply able to walk into the $100K sales job and had to engage in a less dramatic hustle to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>The moral of the story here is that having a high pay sales or finance job that will have you earning ~$500K by age 32 would be great, but the real prize is in growing the side gig. That’s where your real success is going to come from either way.</p>

<p>Gotta pump for commercial RE as an alternative. There are always transactions going on whether it is in capital markets (brokering sales), client rep on the leasing side (landlord/tenant) or even capital raising or asset management. You can covering different asset classes from office, development sites, industrial, retails or hotels. Get into one of the bigger companies which cover them all so if you don’t like one team/asset/service line you can network your way into something different. Its not a grind like IB and if you’ve built up the network deals come to you.</p>
