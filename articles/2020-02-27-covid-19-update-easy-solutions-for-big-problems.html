</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>If you’ve been following our twitter and general view of the virus, unfortunately<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200928053434/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/logical-view-of-the-corona-virus-attempt-to-be-balanced/"> COVID-19 has gotten much worse</a>. Instead of wasting time debating people online we’re just going to outline some basic ways to make sure you’re in good shape once this virus plays out. Fortunately, you don’t need to do much beyond basic precautionary items and some additional cash. We’ll go ahead and get started!</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – The Basic
Stock Up: </strong>There is no need to go overboard. If you’re buying stuff you
would never actually use in the future (that’s a bad move). Simple things
include: brown rice, water, some frozen foods of your choice and replenish some
canned goods. Notice we’re not telling you what specific foods to buy since it
doesn’t matter *that* much. If you have some grains (rice) some protein (beans)
a variety of canned foods and a bunch of water… You’re pretty good to go. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 – “Act Broke”:
</strong>This means you should make a few simple choices. Instead of spending money
on a falling stock market, a falling bond market etc. You should go ahead and
just take the amount you would normally invest and buy the following: 1)
toothpaste, 2) soap, 3) toiletries, 4) basic medical supplies etc. We’re
assuming that you do not have a year’s worth of these items and the chances of
the products going “bad” is next to none. Why would you do this? Quite simple.
By doing a bulk purchase you guarantee a price that is a bit cheaper than
normal (majority reading this unlikely go to Costco very often) and you would have
bought it anyway. This is effectively a guaranteed return. By buying a bunch of
items you would have paid 20% more for, you’ve locked in a gain on future costs
by simply taking additional precautions. Nothing crazy here. If the stock
market recovers the 5-10% it lost, oh well, you saved on goods equal to the
return anyway. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3 – Avoid the
Blame Game: </strong>Unsurprisingly, irrational humans will now blame anyone and
anything for the spread of this virus. Instead of wasting time trying to place
the blame somewhere, go ahead and focus all attention on what you can control.
Classic “stoic response”, which means you’ll only focus on things that are
within your control. Don’t blame other people for the stock market declines (no
one can predict a pandemic out of the blue) and don’t blame doctors for following
medical procedures. None of these things are within the control of the
individual so focus on the micro tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 – Simple Micro
Tasks: </strong>This is quite easy! Simply decrease the areas in which you could be
exposed. If you can work from home, work from home (some major companies
already allow this due to the breakout). If you need to travel, cancel them
unless necessary – free excuse to stay at home. If you can avoid the gym go
ahead and use your own barbells and exercise outside in a more desolate area.
This isn’t really a lot of change but significantly reduces your chances of
being exposed if you’re worried about the potentially contracting the virus. </p>
<p>Other micro tasks that are extremely specific: 1) stop
touching your face, 2) stop opening doors with your bare hands and 3) avoid
public restroom facilities. Again, some of this is simply not possible but you
get the bigger picture. You want to avoid mass gatherings and avoid physical
contact with strangers. It makes a lot of logical sense because this is where
the virus could easily get to you. </p>
<p>Now why would you do this now? Pretty simple. At this point,
even the people who claimed it was “just the flu” have given up. There are too
many cases, international growth is accelerating and we’ve lost the ability to
predict exactly where the infection originated in some situations. What does
this mean? It means that over the next 3 weeks or so we’ll finally see what the
real numbers looks like. People are going to go out less, party less and
congregate less at least for 3-4 weeks. Expect more cancellations of major mass
gatherings. And. There is absolutely no way to know where it is (today) so
basing your behavior based on current cases doesn’t make much sense. Simply
take 3 weeks to be a bit more insulated: read, cook at home a bit more and
public settings where germs are quickly spread.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you must go to work (majority will) just
take a few simple other precautions. Try to walk up the stairs to work, don’t touch
elevator buttons with your hands, don’t touch anything except items in your own
office/work area. This isn’t difficult to remember and costs nothing (maybe 2-3
minutes a day) as you spend a few extra minutes making sure to wash your hands
properly 2x more than usual. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5 – Is this an
Overreaction? </strong>Not really sure. Implementing this for a few days already
hasn’t really caused any damage at all. Going for a jog and doing physical
pushups to failure and sit-ups/pull ups to failure hasn’t been a big change.
Having weights at home isn’t a big deal as well. In fact, not much changes. The
only part that is “painful” is the not going out part. But. Most people are
reducing that anyway… So not that big of a deal (yet again). It’s almost like a
free vacation at this point. Business stalls a bit, you read a bit more and
spend a little bit more time on your computer. The only part that is “annoying”
is the going to Costco part. You have to get the basic essentials out of the
way and after that there isn’t much of a change. You’ll end up saving money by
bulk purchasing food anyway and it won’t cost you more than $300-500. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6 – Rational Math:
</strong>The main problem with the virus is not the death rate of 2%. That’s already
bad. The real problem is that humans do not understand compounding AND step-function
risk. If you attempted to explain step-function risk to 80% of the population,
they would not understand it. Step-function risk is associated with this
virus/disease. What does it mean? It means that some people get no real
reaction. It feels like the common cold, nothing happens and they get over it.
Other people (the 2%) are potentially dead with a high percentage in intensive
care units. <em>You do not want to be in
an intensive care unit</em>. Intensive care means your body is going through
extreme pain/suffering.</p>
<p>The second part, the “step function”, is probably the bigger
issue for us. If it travels like the flu, that’s already bad (high probability
of catching it)… But… The step function is not good. Under no circumstance
would we take a 2% chance on life when it can be avoided by staying indoors for
a few weeks. It’s not that difficult to talk to people through video
conferencing. A 2% chance of dying to a virus that will likely moderate in a
few months is just not worth it. Imagine a game where you have a 98% chance of
being “fine” but a 2% chance of dying completely. You’d never play that game
and three weeks of your life reading and lifting weights at home to avoid it
would certainly be easy. </p>
<p><strong>Key Highlights: </strong>While
we’re not going to tell you exactly what to buy since you may enjoy certain
foods over others here’s what we’re stocked up on: 1) brown rice, 2) beans, 3) variety
of frozen food items from Costco – Chicken Bakes are likely well known to most,
burritos and some frozen veggies, 4) a bunch of cases of still and sparkling
water and 5) a few cases of granola bars and a few large packs of organic soup.</p>
<p>On the other side went ahead and bulk purchased: 1) toothpaste,
2) dental floss, 3) some multi-vitamins, 4) toilet paper/paper towels and 5) soap/hand
sanitizer.  As you can see the list of
items will last forever (practically) and you will use them eventually. So you’re
not “wasting money” by stocking up in the first place. You’re simply well
prepared and the money wouldn’t change your life (we doubt buying the S&amp;P
500 on the exact dip with $500 is going to make a difference in 30 years. </p>
<p><strong>What to Watch For: </strong>We
said it once and we’ll say it again. Do not go to Asia. There is just no reason
to go out there and we do not believe the situation in Thailand for one second.
Significantly more people go to Thailand than Japan/Korea from Wuhan and other
parts of China. Their infection rate is likely understated as many of them
simply had “no real impact” from the virus (see step function risk). Again.
None of this is going to change your life much. You simply take a step back for
three weeks, let everyone else figure it out and play it safe. Also. By doing
this you won’t be stressed out at all since you know you’ve reduced your chances
of catching it by a wide margin and that’s all you can really do in the first
place. </p>

<p>I’m living in Asia now, I would say you are spot on, the place to avoid the most is Southeast Asia, shitty detection and incompetent and under-resourced governments.</p>
<p>The one exception would be Singapore – they have a reputation as a draconian nanny state in the US but in this case it has helped tremendously – they are overzealous about finding and isolating cases (plus contact tracing), plus they have superb medical care. Also helps that they are very small and it’s easy for the authorities to control people movements in and out of the country.</p>

<p>Singapore politicians just announced they will cut their salaries this month and give bonuses to doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>Smart move. This is how you keep the populace happy.</p>
<p>Anyway, the EU should be avoided just as much as Asia if not moreso. Schenghen area + mass immigration = no chance of containment or mitigation. My prediction is Europe will be the hardest hit continent over the long run.</p>
<p>Also, Vietnam is “officially” corona-free at this point. What’s up with that? Even the WHO agrees.</p>

<p>I’ve lived in Manhattan for a few years, I get sick twice as often as I did living in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Got the stomach flu last fall, set me back weeks in terms of efficiency (not to mention feeling like death for a week, no gym or work, etc).</p>

<p>It is WAY LESS than 2%.  2% is out of hospitalizations.  Many more just tough it out at home and are not counted.  How would they be?</p>
<p>Still, your common sense precautions make sense.  Those who think they have to live alone in a cabin for 2 years have obvious problems with reality.  Every week they find something else to be terrified about.</p>

<p>Hi, read my post below. </p>
<p>Unfortunately there’s no much we can do other than washing/sanitizing hands frequently, wearing those silly masks, and avoiding non-essential contact with people.</p>
<p>On the flipside, those of us who can’t afford a full quarantine for financial readons tend to be of a younger age, so in theory even if we catch the virus we are supposed to survive unscathed (death rate is supposedly 0.2% for peole age 10-40).</p>
<p>I’m not so much afraid to die as I’m annoyed. I’d hate to spend 20-30 days in bed with a fever, it’s a lot of time wasted.</p>

<p>The only way to survive a pandemic is to lock yourself up in your home and not go out AT ALL, which implies:<br/>
a) having 2+ years worth of non-perishable food and supplies<br/>
b) being able to work from home (or being wealthy enough that you don’t need to work)</p>
<p>Anything less than that is going to be ineffective. </p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to go out and not touch an object that could have been contaminated. Even the air you breathe could be carrying the virus.</p>
<p>I’m currently overseas and I’ve realized that there’s no way for me to be 100% safe in this country. I don’t own a car, so I’m forced to either walk (surrounded by people who could be infected) or take a taxi (the door handle or seats could be contaminated).</p>
<p>I choose to walk, wearing a face mask (which makes some people laugh in this city), and only going out for 20-30 mins tops, every couple days (i.e. 15 times a month), to buy food and essentials. </p>
<p>Supermarkets here are open 24/7, so I’m doing my shopping at 4:00 AM, when the streets are literally deserted and the only person I have to interact with is the lone, sleepy cashier. I pay with a card so as not to handle potentially contaminated cash.</p>
<p>Even all of this is not nearly enough. The cashier could be sick and he has to handle my groceries and put them in the bag. The groceries themselves could have been contaminated by people who grabbed them, examined them, and put them back on the shelf. So on and so forth.</p>
<p>My landlady lives right above me and she often comes knocking on my door to bring me homemade food. Nice gesture, but you don’t want that during a pandemic. I don’t need her damned food and I wish she came nowhere near my door. Unfortunately, I can’t tell her that without offending her regular-person sensibilities and risk being evicted.</p>
<p>Basically I’m screwed, because no matter how many precautions I take (like going shopping at 4:00 AM with my face fully covered) all the other people around me aren’t taking ANY. I’m doing the best I can and it’s not enough.</p>
<p>A group/society is only as strong as its weakest link… and 99.99% of people are really fucking stupid, including politicians and doctors.</p>
<p>tl;dr  Get rich as early as you can, buy a house in the middle of nowhere, and fill it with supplies. That’s your go-to place for pandemics, wars, and other catastrophes. Nothing but complete isolation from society can save you from society’s problems (heh).</p>

<p>Just got back from New Zealand, it is currently a good place to go and hide out the corona virus if you got the means to stay there. They got a China travel ban, a lot of land for a small population, was about $.70 to a New Zealand dollar, if you get hurt out there health care is free (got stitches from surf accident). Lots of nature, hiking, camping, and city stuff to do as well. It’s there summer right now so escape the cold. Just got to be a able to handle the 13hr flight from the west coast. If I didn’t have a job and brick and mortar business to attend to I would still be there.</p>

<p>The most remote (inhabited) place on earth is Pitcairn Island. Smack in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, virtually no visitors. I would be there right now if I could.</p>
<p>For EU citizens, New Caledonia is a good option. Easy to get into (and stay) since it’s technically part of France.</p>
<p>Nearby Vanuatu is 3 months visa-free for Westerners, and gives 1-year residence permits to anyone who can prove an income of at least $2,500 a month.</p>
<p>New Zealand also good, though they have already confirmed coronavirus cases there.</p>

<p>I’m surprised there’s no mention of the start of a recession/depression due to this virus. After all, your earlier articles were forecasting a recession right about now (or in the next coming months/2021) so I’m surprised you guys aren’t gloating about how you were right. I know, today it might be too early to tell, but based on your predictions I could easily see this being the start… which really makes me wonder where this disease came from in the first place. Also strange (if the recession does indeed start “now”) for it to happen so close to Trump 2020. Just my $0.02</p>

<p>Well, since they aren’t gloating about their predictions coming true, I’ll gloat about mine. As I foretold  weeks ago:<br/>
— Europe hardest hit<br/>
— “First world” countries did a worse job than “third world” ones<br/>
— Cambodia and Mongolia relatively unscathed<br/>
— Pitcairn Islands one of the only places on Earth with 0 cases</p>
<p>Right now I’m in a country with &lt;200 cases and feeling relatively safe. I'm not a financial wizard like WSP so I can't give anyone money advice, but I do geek out on geography/travel and I would encourage people to leave the West as soon as the travel bans are relaxed. *IF* there will be a second wave (we can't say for sure), you'll want to take advantage of the window of opportunity between the two waves to temporarily relocate someplace safer. Very easy to do for those working online. You can always go back to the West in 2-3 years time, when the virus is completely under control (though personally, I'm never going back regardless).</p>

<p>1) A basic whey protein powder is a nice addition to your basics (and by far the cheapest considering you get 20g of proteins per 30g serving). I personally hate the synthetic taste of these powders but a nice daily addition of nutrients is worth it to me.</p>
<p>2) Desinfectional (antiviral) tissues to swipe your desk at home or at work when you come in. Let it sit for 1-3 minutes and all the tiny cunts are history. Approx $0.1/pc where I live.</p>
<p>3) Boost your immunity. This is what I’m concentrating on the most as the risk of infection is just too high with my current lifestyle (wagie) and I will probably catch it if there’s an outbreak where I live. </p>
<p>   a) Zinc. Great for immunity.<br/>
   b) Supplement a little more vitamin D for a few weeks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200928053434/https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583</a><br/>

<p>Seems atypical of your very logical and numerical approach. While the common sense things laid out above makes sense (stop unnecessary travel, refrain from touching your face), let’s take a look at the figures behind this so far:</p>
<p>– 90K cases but 80K cases are within China  so that should eliminate 90% of your worry<br/>
– Assuming somehow you got the virus, the fatality rate is low (only 5% of cases are critical), this should go down even further if you are a young and healthy individual (not above 50)<br/>
– At its peak so far, 100 people died from COVID. this is significantly lower than the amount of people dying from cancer, diabetes, and suicide<br/>
– Everyone should be more worried about suffering from the side-effects of smoking and drinking instead of catching the COVID </p>
