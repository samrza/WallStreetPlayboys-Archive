Essentially, when you choose a city to live in, it is going to depend entirely on where you are in life. If you’re at the younger age of the spectrum (target audience here) you’re likely going to focus much more on economic opportunities since you prefer access to cash flow. While it would be awesome to simply move to the Bahamas and live a relaxing life forever, it doesn’t make a lot of sense economically. As you get older, your priorities change similar to this blog where we’re significantly less interested in chasing a few bucks at the expense of valuable time. So lets begin.</p>
<p><strong>#1 Economics: </strong>For young people, this is the first thing to look. Take a look at the industries in the city, both where is it today and where will it be in about 3-5 years. For the most part, cities don’t change much in a few short years and there is no point in evaluating a city for 10+ years. This is because you’ll be able to move if things don’t work out. The key is making sure you choose the city that’ll generate the highest income. While we are near certain that every smart reader will end up generating online income as outlined in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190909053044/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/efficiency/">Efficiency,</a> we have to be realistic. A lot of smart people begin by taking a career position.</p>
<p>After a decade … This should no longer be the top criteria. It likely falls to the bottom (or near bottom). In a decade you should be focused on improving your quality of life. As we’ve said many times, money is just a tool. If you’re stuck in a city you dislike with friends you loathe and a dating life that is boring… that is not considered successful to us. In a decade or so you’ll be financially set to take more geographic risk (living in cities with less robust economies) while offsetting this with quality of life and lower stress (high net worth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190909053044/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/the-best-forms-of-passive-and-semi-passive-income/">generating passive income</a>).</p>
<p>Now we get into a more interesting territory “later life”. This is where a big fork occurs. If you’re interested in having kids then your cities will change for a third time. If you’re uninterested in having kids, you’ll remain in the second paragraph. At this point, economic activity becomes more important since economic growth is typically associated with higher IQ individuals. In any case, a city that is fun for a bachelor is not going to line up well with raising a family (Las Vegas comes to mind as an example).</p>
<p>Putting this together we’d say your evaluation of a city based on the economy should look something like this: 1) it should take up 80-90% of the value if you’re worth under $1M, 2) it should take less than 20% of the value if you’re a millionaire and 3) it should take up about 33% of the value if you’re having a family.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Demographics: </strong>A good rule of thumb is to avoid cities that have male dominated industries. This would be technology, finance and construction. While New York is a rare exception given that media, fashion and many other industries are prevalent there, this basic filter will help you. The downside? You’re only going to be able to take advantage of this later in life if you’re going to work in Technology/Finance/construction for your first position.</p>
<p>For young people, when you decide on the demographics… Do not rely on people your own age. This doesn’t add much value to you since your peer group will unlikely succeed. People can complain and say if they “change the way they think they’ll make it!” But. It just isn’t true. Talent is real and the reality is that the majority of people are not going to make it. Under 1% of the population under 35 is worth over $1,000,000 (numbers don’t lie). Solution: go and find people in your field and find out what they suggest in terms of a starting place. Take their opinion seriously since cost of living adjustments will impact the city you choose in a dramatic way.</p>
<p>After a decade passes, demographics matter quite a bit. Figure out the type of people you want to be around and get ready to make a few trips. Being rich and forced to hang out with boring people is not on the” to-do-list”. Demographics determine your future rolodex. When you have made it financially you’ll have contacts in the major cities so continuing to build a book isn’t as necessary as it was before (unless you have a bigger number to hit). As an example of demographics, you want to search for 1) average age, 2) male/female ratio, 3) race/ethnicity mix, 4) number of universities in the region , 4) percentage of city that is married and 6) political affiliation. All of these will paint a good picture of the type of people you’ll meet. A good resource for information on the population is worldpopulationreview. This is not good enough but it gives you an idea for your beginning research. If the numbers are largely the same as a city you like it’s probably worth a visit. If it is similar to cities you dislike… cross them off the research list.</p>
<p>Moving to the next decade, demographics will be more important than economic activity if you’re having a family. Why? Well you’re essentially choosing the peer group for your kids. If you’re not going to go down this route, this is typically why successful people live in two cities! If you remain single, you can live in two cities that address two different demographics you enjoy. This could also be driven by weather and outdoor activities as outlined in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Weather and Outdoor Activities: </strong>This is essentially worth nothing for the younger people. If you have no money, fun shouldn’t be prioritized. Every major city has enough to do for a couple of days a week since you’ll be working the rest of the time anyway! Weather won’t be an important quality in the beginning. But. Fast forward and that changes quickly.</p>
<p>A decade later… weather and outdoor activities will become the second most important item on the city living test. If the city has the demographics (people you want to be around) the only other big swing factor is the weather and activities. While it would be interesting to *visit* a city that is freezing all the time with beautiful people… it won’t be enjoyable to stay there long-term. For fun our personal preference is a beach city and an active city. This is a preference as there are some people who enjoy skiing more than the beach and others who simply enjoy living in the country with vast amount of acres (we couldn’t do this). A simple example of a dual city set up here would be Miami and New York. Alternatively it could be Los Angeles and Chicago. We are sure there are millions of other examples but this is a good way to think about a dual city living situation.</p>
<p>Moving again to the later years or next decade or so, the activities are actually quite important if you’re going to have kids. Again, not for us but for many people. This will determine the number of “attempts” they get at finding a talent. If you’re in a city with limited activities, you’re going to be limited in your guesses as well. The ideal city in that situation would be any major city that has a driving culture. Why? Well in a driving culture city you likely have more space which typically means more quality facilities. There is a reason why Texas and Southern California product quality athletes across multiple sports while congested cities produce athletes in more indoor activities. Activities determine the number of talent tests. To cap it off, if you’re going to remain single this is still important as it gives you more options for fun. But. It isn’t a deal breaker because you can always hop on a plane.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Taxes: </strong>Similar to weather and outdoor activities, taxes will unlikely be relevant. People will say that “the 8% saved makes a difference”. But. This isn’t really true. The goal for young people is to scale up responsibility as fast as possible since a $10-20K difference in year 1, 2 and 3 isn’t going mean anything. It barely gets you a single Bitcoin these days anyway. Unless there is an equal amount of upward mobility (the Company is headquartered in a tax free state for example) this shouldn’t be taken as a big part of your decision making.</p>
<p>Once you reach the next stage, taxes become unbearably important. A change in tax rate makes a huge dent into investment income (bonds, REITs, Real Estate, boring savings accounts etc.). That said, the city you live in determines a lot of the tax consequences creating an opportunity for you. From our experience, this is a big factor for the first 5-6 years of “new living” where you value your time over making a few extra bucks. After that it fades and you may find yourself changing cities for a third time.  <em><u>Side note:</u></em> A high quality signal that someone is well off? Their level of hatred for the amount of taxes they pay. Unquestionably the worst day of the year.</p>
<p>As you move forward, taxes become less important in theory. If you’re interested in maximizing *net worth* they matter. But. If you’ve played your cards right you have more than enough money. We realize this may sound like a contradiction to the side note, but it isn’t. If you’re just over financial independence, a 10% difference is a big change. If you’re 3-5x over financial independence it is much less relevant (you’ll hate paying them even more though!).</p>
<p><strong>#5 Infrastructure and Laws: </strong>This is a big one for the younger generation. When you move to a new city, doing everything “right” offers a large return on a percentage basis. Look into: 1) rental laws, 2) public transportation and 3) the services of the city. Rental laws allow you to decide if there are ways to game the city, from rent control to elongating leases for lower monthly payments. Public transportation is self-explanatory as a major city should allow you to move without a car (won’t be using uber black daily like you will in the future). Services determine nightlife and culture, with shorter nightlife you’re looking at day time activities and with a *low-cost* services industry you’re looking at a lower stress city.</p>
<p>In the future, this changes from rental laws to property tax/rental laws in the eyes of the owner. Public transportation drops off the list as it won’t make a change to your budget and you’ll rarely use it (only to save time). Services become more important as you ramp up the quality of your life and you look to free up valuable time. After all, if services can save you 5-6 hours a week and you can’t make more money to offset the cost… something isn’t working properly (it implies you’re making less than the cost of services!).</p>
<p>Capping it off, in the later years, your focus then shifts to public education and safety for your kids if you go down that route. If you’re more likely to remain a bachelor you’re sticking with the same items in the second paragraph with a heavy emphasis on services since you’re looking to maximize your free time. Keeping a pulse on the demographics and laws are constant (every month or so try to see if there are any big changes).</p>
<p><strong>Fun Recommendations (Assumes second stage): </strong>Can’t really have this post without recommendations. Remember, this is for people who enjoy cities (and want to remain single). Good cities for this type of person include: Miami, Las Vegas, Dallas/Austin Texas (although Austin is seeing a demographic shift), Los Angeles for those that want to live in California, New York City and Chicago. There is a relatively wide range here since we assume you’ll be less money hungry after succeeding over the first decade. While money motivation used to be high, it dies quite a bit once you make it (assuming your personality is wired for freedom and not materialism). That said everyone has a different lifestyle and those cities offer a wide range. Miami is better for lower stress offset by lower economic opportunities. Vegas is essentially a city similar to LA without the weather (desert version of LA) and lower taxes. Chicago/NYC are good for economics and bad for taxes. To cap it off Texas is essentially Miami with much lower costs and no beach/worse weather.</p>

<p>Visit both</p>
<p>I grew up in austin and live here now.<br/>
I hated it until I actually started getting a paycheck.</p>
<p>Theres a lot to do. Domain/east 6th/west 6th/ rainey street bar scenes. Great night life. Plenty of day drinking on sundays/saturdays as well. Breweries everywhere</p>
<p>Outdoor shit. lakes, springs, rivers, creeks. You can swim in all of them. Saturday I was with a friend under a sick canopy with people paddles boarding by and you get in the water and its like 50 degrees and the outside is 100. Shit is just cool</p>
<p>Little competition. Not many girls tho, Most are in college fucking fraternity guys.</p>
<p>The hotties that are living here 22-27 are looking for money. Because they either they bartend, serve, dead end office, Spin class/personal train. Tons of goofy techie guys and weird austinites (losers), cool guy with money can run circles here. If your social+looks+money the place is a playground.</p>
<p>Tho money may be less important here because the culture is young and looks are super important.</p>
<p>Dallas is competitive as fuck. That is all I know.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Agree 100% with the article. When you are young you can’t succeed by working at no name firms in the middle of nowhere that pay you nothing. You are basically killing your early career because you aren’t willing to sacrifice for a few years. Most young people are too short-cited to make sense of this. </p>
<p>Why no analysis of Europe? </p>
<p>European analysis:</p>
<p>Age 20-35: London/Berlin/Stockholm = Finance/Tech/Fashion hubs. You’ll be broke early on but pay rockets if you make the right career moves. Super diverse industry/sector wise so you won’t just be around one type of person or industry. If you have STEM/Quant skills in Europe you can literally move from Finance to Tech to Fashion in these key cities (at the same pay rate) without much of an issue. Another overlooked benefit of these cities – opportunities. Pretty much everywhere else in Europe you’ll be doing yourself a diservice financially (In Paris/Milan 35-45K Euros is a great salary for a top graduate in Engineering or Law – LOL).</p>
<p>Age 35+: Assuming you made enough money apply the dual-city model (A) Either move out completely (if you are running a business) (B) Move to a smaller city with higher pay for senior level talent OR just live on the outskirts of one of the major cities and work less hours/move to a relaxed sector that will pay you well for your 10+ years of expertise in a tough city.</p>
<p>Dual cities for frequent holidays or second homes: Think Lisbon (Portugal) or practically anywhere in Greece/Spain. Super cheap for the quality of life you get.</p>

<p>Hey KingQuant, just saw your comment, sorry for the late bump. Graduate from top tier Quantitative Masters program here. I been getting depressed at the low salaries I see e.g. in London, plus the weather is shit and the women ugly hahaha. Could you please elaborate on how (and how much) the pay skyrockets if you make the right career moves?  I think this would interest many readers that are not in the US. </p>
<p>Also what do you think of Zurich? Entry level salaries are 100k – ish there, the highest I’ve seen in Europe for entry. However I am not sure how that scales or if the city is good overall.</p>
<p>P.S. Love the username!</p>

<p>If you’re going for the dual city approach, I would pick a second city outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>Makes no sense for most people to operate in two cities in the U.S.</p>

<p>Interesting article. As I have posted many times before, I’m in my early 30’s, worth essentially $2M, and married w/ family aspirations etc. Despite having a solid amount of $ (all self made in finance) at a relatively young age, I feel trapped in NYC area and know that I need to keep grinding for a long time bc of the costs involved w raising a family. Perhaps, I will have the flexibility to leave the area some day when I have enough to support an entire family, but that seems far away, particularly if we stay in this area!</p>

<p>Beijing Shanghai are great stage 1 places for building career assuming you can either learn or speak Chinese.  however taxes are crazy high</p>
<p>Hong Kong are is your best stage 2 place and provides great nightlife and low tax but stuff like housing and schooling are super expensive so have to get out if you want to move to stage 3 unless you have 10m+</p>
<p>Singapore is amazing stage 2 or 3 place, much cleaner safer than HK and much more space.  anyways if you are at this stage you probably have a second house in HK, tokyo or australia. so if you want to get out of the bubble you can always jump on a flight.  fun fact: sg hanger space is very limited so if you have a private plane most people keep them in malaysia as it is much cheaper; they just get their planes to fly over and pick you up.</p>
<p>Tokyo is great but good luck finding a high level job.</p>
<p>Forget about Seoul unless you are Korean.</p>

<p>For South Korea, same dynamic occurs. Seoul is more like Korea’s NYC, while Busan is more of a less economic/dating opportunity, higher quality common areas, and proximity to Jeju island for outdoor activities-more of a San Diego/LA vibe with lots of shipping.</p>

<p>Depends what your price range is. You can actually rent a studio in LA  for ~$1,500 or so in many neighborhoods (though not in Santa Monica or Beverly Hills). San Diego will be ~30% cheaper, but far fewer opportunities to make $. Just make sure to not move to places like Riverside.</p>

<p>What do you do for fun?  </p>
<p>I’m not talking experiences like world traveling, just day to day stuff.</p>
<p>All my long-time friends are working stiffs with jobs &amp; families.</p>
<p>I checked out an exotic car club &amp; a sailing club but the people were mostly my parents age.</p>
<p>I dont care for partying hard, staying out late, and eating garbage at 2AM anymore.</p>
<p>When I’m not working on my business I have a hard time finding interesting things to do.</p>

<p>Hobbies.</p>
<p>From SoCal and when I’m not working or out in Hollywood I keep myself busy with MMA/BJJ and spirited driving in the canyons (Angeles Crest Highway, Mulholland Drive, etc.) in my Mercedes-AMG.</p>
<p>Combat sport gyms and car meets (ie. Cars &amp; Coffee Irvine) are also both great opportunities to network with high-quality men, unlike the normie trash you’d see at a music festival or club.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Glad this post was made, I am pretty miserable here in Atlanta. </p>
<p>For one, it seems like the social scene in your 20s is all a carry over from the SEC frat life. Bars are Uber cliquish in Buckhead and the areas where the party is at. Same top 20 rap songs played at every bar. </p>
<p>It seems like tons of people get married in their 20s here as well, usually by late 20s or so.</p>
<p>Dating wise, don’t bother unless you are into black women. White women here are in short supply and usually go for former frat guys even if they ended up not doing much with their lives.</p>
<p>People here also seem really snobbish but in the way you mentioned San Francisco as being snobbish. Tons of passive aggressive and self-righteous types here. </p>
<p>I find that it is so tough to land quality here even for rich guys who seem cool because dating here is bizarre world. You see hot girls with tubby country boys just because they had frat or social circle status and so much runs on social circle here. </p>
<p>Thinking about moving soon.</p>
