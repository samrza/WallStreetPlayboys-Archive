For fun, since we’ve racked up more miles than we could possibly imagine the last ~2 years, we’re going to give out all the tricks you’ll need for traveling. In addition, since we’re selling one of our internet assets (expected close on October 30, 2017) we have a small announcement as well. We have no idea if this post will be of interest, but if you plan on making a good deal of money you’ll likely be forced to travel quite a bit for at least one year of your working life. If you end up getting a good <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190829220656/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/enterprise-sales-a-legitimate-career-to-get-rich/">career in sales</a>? You’ll be traveling quite a bit as you move up the stack.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Airport Skills</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have additional airport travel ideas be sure to drop a comment. That said we think we’ll cover a ton of time saving tips with this post alone. After racking up hundreds of thousands of miles, you’ll find multiple tricks that work and we have no problem giving them away for free. Besides. Time is something we never get back so we may as well save it starting on day one!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 1 – Clear, Pre-check/Global Entry and Others: </strong>The first step is to get pre-check or Clear/Global Entry. We prefer using Clear/Global Entry but the difference is relatively minimal. Unless you plan on doing a lot of international travel, going with Pre-check will work perfectly fine (otherwise go with Global Services). You’d be surprised at how much time this will save you in an airport. While the lines are perhaps a tad shorter (lots of travelers do have pre-check) <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the key is that the people are organized.</span></em> Instead of dealing with swaths of people taking their shoes off, forgetting laptops and not remembering to clear out their pockets… The vast majority are <strong>fast. </strong>We estimate total time savings of 15 minutes by signing up for these programs. On a round trip flight that 30 minutes a trip. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tons of recovered time.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 2 – Booking: </strong>Ideally, book all flights with zero connections. It is better to fly in economy/economy plus and take a direct flight, than sit in business class and be stuck in the airport due to a missed connection. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Always book direct.</span></em> We know… This isn’t possible 100% of the time. In the cases when you’re forced to fly with connections, book the longest leg first and the shortest leg second. This is because there are typically more flights when you’re closer to the location. Flights from NYC to Boston are quite frequent (called the shuttle) so you’re better off flying into Boston then to NYC <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>vs.</strong></span> flying into another city such as Chicago then to NYC. We think this will save you a few hours of time per year since you’re less likely to miss meetings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 3 – Seating &amp; Packing: </strong>Best to take the window seat. This is obvious but the aisle is prone to issues. Aisle seats require you to potentially move if other passengers need to get up and walk around. And. The flight crew will bump into you 90% of the time. People are not coordinated and Aisle seats are actually harder to sleep in. Book the window which is the main purpose of staying organized (booking early)….  Now… When it comes to packing you already know our basic rule. Choose an international carry on bag only. This makes you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190829220656/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/efficiency/">more efficient</a> and you won’t need two different carry on bags for flying.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 4 – Time Saving Items in the Airport: </strong>Now that your trip is set up you should utilize the Airport for the most advantages. If you’re not part of the club (or the airport doesn’t have a club) you can still take advantage of items found in airports. The main ones are relatively cheap massages that do work (a good habit to have as<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190829220656/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/life-changing-items-to-be-aware-of-as-you-get-older/"> flexibility goes down with age</a>), shoe shines and places that offer juicing (vegetables). Ideally, you’ll find the exact amount of travel time to minimize down-time in an airport, but keep both of these items in mind if you want to get there ~25 minutes earlier than usual.  A basic massage (15-20 minutes) and a juice 5 minutes, will knock out two items you needed anyway – improved flexibility and high quality calories. Notice… If for some reason you’re flying to a place with food options that are lower in quality, the answer is to get to the airport 15 minutes early to grab a healthy juice before getting on the flight!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next time saving item is a bit more extreme. Since you’ll likely get into one of the higher priority boarding groups, there is no reason to shave before going to the airport. If you’re one of the first passengers on board, you can simply hop into the stall shave and sit down before the flight is fully boarded. This applies to all of your basic morning routines (excluding a shower). Add all of these items up and you should be able to save 15 minutes per trip depending on how you want to organize the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 5 – Health: </strong>Flying is terrible for your health. Do not be fooled by the “glamour” of flying a lot. Anyone who enjoys flying has never really had to fly a lot. The conditions in an airplane are not good as you’re exposed to 1) more bacteria (potential to get sick), 2) cabin pressure which is terrible for blood flow and 3) the dreaded conversation with the person sitting next to you (wish we were kidding, it’s typically terrible). To combat all of these items you need to be prepared for the flight with the basics.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first thing is compression arm sleeves and compression socks. If you think we are kidding, we are not. The main problem with flying is that you’re sitting down in a pressurized cabin which restricts blood flow. The reason why people feel terrible (even if they sleep the whole time) after a flight is due to this issue. Your body is not meant to sit down in a pressurized cabin for multiple hours in a row. We recommend getting at least two pairs of each (compression socks or leg sleeves) and compression arm sleeves. If for some reason you believe this is too “weird”… simply wear a long sleeve shirt and jeans. No one will notice anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second thing is also in-line with blood flow (notice a trend?!). We also recommend taking a ginger shot with cayenne pepper or taking a Baby Asprin 30 minutes before the flight. Ginger shots with cayenne improve blood blow and you can even get this at a Jamba Juice for a few bucks. Otherwise pack your bag with a small stash of baby Asprins. Taking a tiny pill a few times a month isn’t going to do anything and many people take them daily to help blood flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next items are common but easily forgotten. You’ll need 1) a face mask for sleeping, 2) ear plugs, 3) a book and 4) a pack of gum. These are all self explanatory but to keep it all in one place, a face mask is to aid sleeping, the ear plugs prevent people from bothering you with small talk and a book is for helping your eyes get tired (no blue lights!). The pack of gum is more of an add on. When you’re on a flight it is much more likely that you breathe out of your mouth due to dehydration/pressure/moisture change, this will cause you wake up feeling worse and gum helps you get back to normal steady state within 5 minutes of landing… And… To cap it all off, feel free to add a pillow if needed. We’ve found it unnecessary (takes up too much space) and doesn’t seem to make sleeping any easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 6 – Ready for Take Off: </strong>Since you’re well prepared you’re now set to either sleep or read. You’ll avoid all of the bad items on a flight (alcohol/carbonated drinks). You’re better off staying hydrated since flights (again) are not good for your health. Drink water or an electrolyte drink before and during flight (grab some coconut water at the airport). It is likely obvious, however, if you plan to sleep you’ll want to position your body at an angle with your head close to the window and your feet facing diagonally (maximizing leg room). Assuming you’re not in a lay-flat seat (majority of shorter flights are not lay-flat) the goal is to maximize the angle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 7 – Bonus Items: </strong>Unless you’re balling out of control flying private everywhere, you’ll be in this mixed position of having some business class flights and some economy flights. The main idea here is to go for business class when you can get on lay-flat beds. This is important. The value of sitting in business class is probably 100x higher if the flight has a lay-flat bed vs a standard “lazy boy” chair. If you’re on a long flight that has some options for lay-flat beds and standard business class, go for the lay-flat flight if you’re going to pay for business class in the first place. You’ll wake up feeling a lot better with this set-up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Personal Finance Announcement</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As many of you know we started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190829220656/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/questions/">Q&amp;A</a> to see if we should create a forum. Our answer has come to a resounding “no” for now. That is because 90% of the questions came around investing, how much people should aim to have and other such items. So? We’re simply going to create a product to address that question. It won’t take us a long time to make (likely 3 months) and we’ll clean up our inbox since 90% of the questions are around this topic (was not covered in Efficiency). <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Also. If you paid for a question related to personal finance (and we answered) you’ll get the product for free.</span></em> The outline is below and if there are other topics please let us know and we’ll crank it out over the next ~3 months. Timing was perfect since we’re unloading a website (have bids at a price we’d sell for already!) and will have a month or two of downtime to focus on anything Personal Finance related. The outline is below:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;">Where to invest your first $10K after you have already started a business that is profitable?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">How Many Income Streams to have by Age</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">How Much Money Should You Have (benchmarks through age 40)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Overviews of Stocks: where we are personally invested and what we see happening over the next 5-10 years</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Overview of Crypto Currency Investing: what we own and why</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Overview of Real Estate: where we are now investing and what we would do today depending on age</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Overview of Bonds/CDs: how much cash and lower risk we’d have</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Portfolio Overview by Age: how much risk is too much or too little risk</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>If you have another topic please leave it in the comments. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>On a final note… We also saw a lot of mis-interpretation around Efficiency. We stated several times you’ll need $50K to create a business <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this assumes you will create the actual product.</span></em> If your goal is to be an affiliate selling products that someone else creates your cost to starting up is likely around $1K. Our post on starting a Company being the best way to get rich<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190829220656/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/is-starting-a-company-the-least-risky-option-to-get-rich/"> assumes you go the product route. </a></p>

<p>I use a blow-up neck pillow for my longer flights. Amazon for ~$10. Packs away easily as you just inflate / deflate it as needed. I also carry some melatonin with me which is naturally produced to make you sleepy. Very helpful for combating jet lag and helping me sleep on the plane. Kindle is a great product as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification on the cost of starting your own business. I’m looking into a private-label product right now which should cut the 50k cost dramatically.  My problem now is that I want to create that second income, but I also want to put as much cash in crypto as it is very early in the space! Market penetration is 0.01% globally so there is a absolute ton of room for growth. It’s risky but I’m 22 so I’ll simply hold long term and DCA.</p>

<p>All these questions are  subjective socioeconomic indicators of wealth not offering any useful information bar dick inches. Tell your readers the variable of wealth creation isn’t age or status, it’s profitability of you investments. Risk aversion would be the only dependant of age as per point 8 because age determines how many years you could have to recoup/capitalise on investmetst . That’s it.</p>

<p>You should talk about the admin logistics of portfolio management etc but at the end of the day, your investment vehicle should be strategised within frame work of long-term risks/rewards (profitability) and also economising the personal time and effort of doing so. The discussion elevates to college level finance/economic theory. People just need to read up and do the arithmetic to understand the theory behind application, everything else is mostly fluff.</p>

<p>This will be far from something worthless like economic theory or a college course, literally laughed out loud. The only valuable part is application (have to decide what is going to happen later, today… now)</p>

<p>Lol okay man. So if people are emailing constantly for our opinions we shouldn’t put them out makes sense!</p>
<p>We’ll shut down the blog now. In fact all blogs should be shut down!</p>
<p>Hopefully you see the joke now. Economic theory is LOL funny, those losers make like $250K a year.</p>
<p>To cap it all off we don’t care about average go getter he’s not the target audience. We even ban ridiculous comments like “how to make 6 figs” </p>

<p>I’ll add to this by saying, if you book early (which you should be), opt to sit towards the back of the plane. The air hostesses tend to be more attentive to passengers in the back of the plane.</p>

<p>The fresh air arrive by the front of the plane, than goes into the plane from front to tail. So by sitting on the back of the plane, you get the worse air 🙁</p>
<p>Also on a lot of flights, there is only an open door on the front of the plane, so you will have to wait for everyone to get out before it’s your turn…</p>

<p>Sleeping/Jet Lag<br/>
In tandem with sleep mask, I prefer to use noise cancelling headphones + light ambient music to aid in sleeping.</p>
<p>Melatonin as mentioned above or Valerian root can assist with sleeping. I used to go to the airport pretty baked and that helped me sleep the most.</p>
<p>Most of my flights are 12 hr time changes. Best way I found to avoid jet lag is to power thru the shitty day one with a full and active schedule. Absolutely no napping. I find I am 100% adjusted on day two. </p>
<p>If you can swing it, as you mentioned, business class w/ bed is game changer for long hauls. This makes me 100% adjusted on day one.</p>
<p>Lounges/Airline Clubs<br/>
Build up enough miles/pts with one of the air line clubs so you got lounge access. Suitable area for work with faster and/or no BS WiFi. Also reduces number of interactions with populace decreasing opportunities to get sick.</p>
<p>Further with airline club, normally you get special line rather than the common line for boarding plane. This is important so you can secure the overhead cabin space for your int’l carry on rather than chance it to be checked, in the event it’s too full. Not so much a problem on international flights, but common problem on domestics.</p>
<p>When I land after 15 hr flight, I feel like shit. Lounge showers make me fresh and the humidity generated from hot shower can more quickly moisten up your dried out respiratory system, again reducing chance to get sick. </p>
<p>Disagreeing with the above, I would suggest sitting closer to the front than the back of the plane. You’ll get served meals first and then can go to sleep earlier. Also guarantee they won’t stock out of the meal you like if your picky. When landing, you get to disembark the plane earlier and then can join the next line(customs/taxi) with less people in queue. Also, walk faster than normal people, which you should already be doing if you have purpose in your life.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Two tips I’ve learned:</p>
<p>1 – Park in the lots in or close to the terminal. No economy parking. Yes terminal costs 2x what economy does, but you can be in your car leaving the airport while the economy folks are waiting for the bus/train to the economy parking lots, fighting the crowds there, and then walking and driving even farther to get out. Especially if you are traveling on someone else’s dime (aka it’s expensable!) pay the extra money and save the time. This also lets you get *to* the airport closer to your flight, especially if combined with Pre.</p>
<p>2 – Facial moisturizing. As WSP mention, the flight will dry you out; even if you hydrate it can have an impact on your skin. Get a good moisturizing mask and apply while doing your other pre-takeoff stuff once seated. I don’t mean one of those face covering muds, or some cheap shit. Research quality skin care products, and get a small jar — a little goes a long way. </p>
<p>As always, thanks for a great article!</p>

<p>Sorry if this is a double-post, Firefox did something odd.<br/>
I am a big fan of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190829220656/http://www.seatguru.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.seatguru.com</a>. Not all econ/business/1st class seats are created the same. Some are too close to the lavatory, some don’t have underseat storage, etc. and seatguru is a good way to figure that out while you are picking your seats.<br/>
The most important (health-related) rule for flying is no drinking (alcohol) at all (well, maybe one beer/wine with a meal, maybe). No drinking at the bar/lounge before the flight and none during the flight. It’s dehydrating and screws with your sleeping.</p>

<p>We emailed ownmyhood here is his response:</p>
<p>Hah caught me while I’m at my desk:</p>
<p>1) Saved up a low six fig amount (can’t remember what my bank account balance was, but let’s say $150k).  Bought first building using vanilla residential loan with about half of savings as a down payment.  Building was in rough shape, used nights and weekends to work on it (would also skip work at the day job when I could, as the bulk of my pay was commission and I had little oversight). Put probably another $20k into it in materials (if we counted value of my time, would probably triple that amount).  After that building was quite a bit nicer and has had positive cash flow every year since.</p>
<p>When judging by the numbers alone, the ROI/ROE on that first deal wasn’t anything to write home about.  When you factor in the knowledge I gained and how I’ve since used it scale the business it ended up returning quite a bit.</p>
<p>2) Made a lot of mistakes with renovations and tenant selection along the way, did my best not to make them again.</p>
<p>3) After buying that first building and growing more comfortable with buildings/tenants/market/cost of renovating I did some higher leverage deals that grew the size and scope of my operation to the point I needed to bring in outside help.  Started with contractors, eventually switched to hiring employees.</p>
<p>4) After doing a number of higher leverage deals, I decided to take my foot off the gas a bit and return to putting more down in order to decrease risk.</p>
<p>If I did it now?  Due to low interest rates, aggressive lending and the trend of town and city centers gentrifying, prices have shot up quite a bit from when I started.  Regardless, I would probably start the same way I did, buy a small property, use it to learn the ropes, then just bank cash until the next market crash and once it happened, start snatching up buildings.  Once market turned around and banks start lending again, refi a couple of the properties you bought for cheap and use that money to increase holdings.  Then use cashflow to fund further purchases (or invest in another biz).</p>

<p>What’s most relevant to you is “what they would do if they were starting today”, so lets look at that.</p>
<p>I agree with what ownmyhood says, and one big takeaway which I believe I put in a former guest post or answer to it is that buying a building and getting the experience is worth doing a mediocre deal; you’re also getting an education.</p>
<p>Someone that I’ve been mentoring is closing their first deal, looks like they’ll get 12%-18% depending on how things work out, with the ability to refi cash out all their money in a year. Not bad for their first. This person looked at many, many bad deals, even if just looking meant shooting me over comps, calling me etc. for me to explain how I saw it. But often it was them traveling out to just see houses, whether they told me about them prior or not, to see what’s out there and understand the terrain.</p>
<p>They also spent a large amount of time listening to podcasts, reading forums, basically just trying to get some theoretical education. This was at my direction because I didn’t want to continuously answer beginner questions and if I say something like “ARV” I expect the person I’m talking to to know what that means without me having to explain it. This also was a net benefit instead of the possibly net negative in that they had me to guide them on what the garbage was, what was good, what were the possible nuances or caveats missing in what they were reading. As opposed to be guided by some random person on the internet with no way to verify the information or the person’s credentials.</p>
<p>So I’d add find someone (local, who understands your market) who is willing to help you, a person more successful and who you won’t compete with. Of course you’ll need to add value to them. But that will also give you context to what you’re seeing on the streets and learning otherwise. And. It’s always exciting to help a young, hungry, smart guy getting his first deals. It’s action. Play to that.</p>
<p>Besides that, read over mine and ownmyhoods and Nixon’s posts and replies, theirs enough for you there.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>Dude you are already ahead of 99%. </p>
<p>If you’re investing for security, buy an asset – for wealth, buy growth. I’d personally look at getting clients together for some sort of accounting product. </p>
<p>Start building a personal brand (blog/youtube/medium.com – share specific things you learned from your consulting gig, don’t worry about audience they will come **IF** face out there) and continually look for ways to integrate new revenue-generators into current pipeline. </p>
<p>ALWAYS look for chinks in the armor. There will be some under-utilized solution which you can package into some e-book/online widget and sell it on something like Clickbank. Do this on your nights off (outsource the making of the product and keep costs to a *bare* minimum). Read efficiency to learn how to sell said product and when you start making money, double down on your personal brand by licensing said product to other accounting companies (B2B). </p>
<p>If product does well, build company (hire staff) around product and make sure the company is known for *that* specific thing (do NOT diversify) — good example is Simon Dolan from UK who did this and had a £67m exit for his company “Dolan Accountancy”.</p>

<p>– Always get noise canceling airplugs like BOSE one, doesn’t take a lot of space and it is a game changer. It’s also way better than just air plugs because you can have music and in flights where there is baby crying for hours 5 seats away, it’s better to avoid a lot of stress…<br/>
– If you have an extra mid size bag, always take the speed boarding option as most companies are not going to bother you with the dimensions if you pay that extra fee (and you avoid checking in the bag and having to wait after the flight)<br/>
– Dont take seats close to the toilets, you are going to have a hard time with people bumping in your seat all the time<br/>
– Flights are the perfect time to catch up on podcasts, that way you can listen and keep your eyes closed most of the time and avoir them to get dry, in my experience it’s better than reading<br/>
– Even when I’m not sleeping, I still keep sun glasses to avoid the crappy lights in the plane and eyes fatigue that came with that<br/>
– If you have a bad seat, dont wait and as soon as the flight is loaded ask if there is empty seats else where. If you wait, other people are going to take them right away.</p>

<p>Was wondering if someone who’s ‘made it’ could comment below. One of the weirdest things about having money is the skyrocketing increase in your time value. Yes it makes you more attractive to women and to high NW contacts (they are in the same boat) but boy is it hard to face the existential questions that come with it. WSP approach to this is simply ‘realize life is meaningless’. For those who understand, what is your approach to this and why?</p>

<p>Thanks for the post. </p>
<p>Few advice that worked for me.<br/>
– put neosporin inside your nostrils – disgusting as it sounds – it works in repelling bad bacteria (better than putting some hand sanitizer on your hands)<br/>
– Clean the screen and table in front of you (it has more bacteria than the toilet seat and you will likely touch it)<br/>
– Aspirin is a good blood thinner – so is ginger (in juiced form – Mother**** ball for those who know)<br/>
– Say you need extra-time to install yourself in your seat to the gate agent before boarding (no need to say why) – will allow you to go just after business class (irrelevant on long flights).</p>
<p>Personal Finance Broad Question – investment is great but how about day-to-day expenses management / optimization + update of your post on investment priorities.<br/>
Follow-up questions:<br/>
– Personal Capital is a great app – how do you use it?<br/>
– Did you have good efficient processes when having less money – prevent overspending etc.?</p>

<p>Agree on the Bose noise cancelling. I wish I had found those earlier, it’s a game changer! </p>
<p>I use the Bose QuietComfort 20: they are inconspicuous (look like regular earplugs) and you can sleep with them unlike with the wireless version. Drastically reduces not only cabin noise but also engine noise. You don’t even need to plug them to an music player, it works standalone too.</p>
<p>Highly recommended, I’m never boarding on a plane again without those babies!</p>

<p>Good places to keep track of latest developments on investments? For example, crypto is evolving so quickly. What good ways are there to keep track of it.Currently I use reddit, coindesk etc. but its time consuming to keep monitoring these for hard forks etc.</p>

<p>This pertains to point 4. Stocks with a 5-10 year horizon. I think the following would add value to your readers (I’ve mentioned these concepts in previous posts) :</p>
<p>– Skew profile of investment: you want to know this profile so you can have a system to protect yourself against tail risk</p>
<p>– Expected risk/return profile of your investment: look for positive expected return and positive skew</p>
<p>– Diversify: you have already written about uncorrelated return streams. Same goes for investing. You will get more return per unit of risk this way. Diversifying means more than bonds/equities –  owning 100 equities that are 70% correlated doesn’t cut it. </p>
<p>– Position sizing: not what you buy but how much. Will that 2% allocation to your favourite stock really outperform a 10% IWM position? </p>
<p>Anyone with 2m in investable cash should have an understanding and an allocation to a solid diversified CTA/managed futures program. In short, they have 1) positive expected return 2) positive skew 3) uncorrelated (different to negatively correlated) to equities, bonds, other HF strategies (merger arb, relative value etc).</p>

<p>I remember when I used to talk to people on flights. I was a total noob back then. Now I fly at least 20 times a year and the last thing I want to do is talk to anyone at the airport or aboard an airplane. Honestly, I’m even a little annoyed when a member of the flight crew attempts to look at my ticket when I’m boarding. I know where my seat is, thank you, let’s not have this fake-polite conversation and don’t bother thanking me for flying when I de-board either.</p>
<p>When I arrive at the airport, my earbuds go in and they don’t come out unless I’m going through security or immigration or talking to a cute girl.</p>
<p>A trip from one country to another than involves talking to zero people is a good trip.</p>
