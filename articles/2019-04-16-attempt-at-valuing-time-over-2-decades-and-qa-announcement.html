<p>There is no real way to quantify the value of time so we’re
going to attempt it right here. As we’ve stated many times in the past, health
is by far the most important thing in life as the loss of health makes you 1)
lose time and 2) lose money. Since time is more valuable than money, you
actually suffer a huge loss as your time evaporates and health issues usually
come at a severe financial cost. Lately, we’ve been focusing a bit more on
paying attention to your body (massage therapy, diet etc.) and this is due to
the natural slowdown past age 30-35 or so. Mathematically speaking, you’ve got
a solid 30 years or so where life is at peak performance (age 20 to 50, where
20 is more energy specific and 50 is more freedom and money specific). </p>
<p><strong>Value of Each Decade:
</strong>One of the main themes around here is that if you give up a solid 3-5 years
of your life (typically only takes 3 years), by the time you’re around 25-27
you’re so far ahead of the game that each decade gets better. So far, this has
continued to be the case. The downside is when you look back in time and ask
yourself “would I be able to do all that work in my mid 30s”, the ugly truth is
a resounding no. No. We’re not saying “to give up” if you haven’t made it yet.
All we’re doing is pointing out a simple fact of life, energy levels decline
from your 20s to your mid-30s to your 40s etc. Instead of pondering about how
to adjust for this we’re going to write it out here from actual experience. </p>
<p><strong>Early 20s: </strong>This
is where quantity over quality pays off without question. Everyone in their
early 20s is drunk. They are partying in some way and going nowhere as they
spend their entire paycheck every month. The funny thing is that their
productivity at work doesn’t even take a hit as a person this young can easily party
3-4 nights a week without any hit to productivity. This is due to the value of
youth. The reason why people say “youth is wasted on the young” is because that
level of energy can be used to learn and produce hundreds of things at the same
time with no real impact to the physical body. People like to “claim” your
health is ruined by working long hours but the reality is partying or working
hard leads to the same thing… literally no impact to your future health. Trying
to do either of these things (working 80 hours a week) or partying late into
the night extremely drunk 4 nights a week at age 35? Not going to be a pretty
outcome. </p>
<p>Quantity over quality applies to practically everything
here. It isn’t difficult to recall the ability to drink lower quality liquor
and not even recognizing the difference between the “good stuff” and the “cheap
stuff”. This is because your body is able to process everything from pasta to
junk food to bad alcohol. Use this to your advantage. You can work extremely
hard and still go out a 1-2x a week without severely impacting your future. A
great set up. Try every single type of venture that comes to your mind, to
rattle off a few here we go: 1) affiliate marketing, 2) a cheap brick and
mortar, 3) a fixer upper real estate deal, 4) a fitness coaching idea and 5) absolute
worst case scenario, a second job. In the end throwing a bunch of spaghetti at
the wall and seeing what sticks is a good strategy here.</p>
<p><em>Time Value:</em>
Luckily, we maintain basic journals every single day. After over 20 years of
data, we’ve noticed that it was possible to sleep ~6-7 hours a day and work
9-12 hours a day (one rest day) without feeling fatigued at all. When you hit
your mid 30s, this just isn’t possible. Before jumping there we can run a quick
calculation. 10 hours of “real focused work” per day is 60 hours a week. Then
you add an additional 2 hours a day of “basic work” essentially grunt work that
needs to be done, and <em>you’re looking
at 72 hours of productivity per week</em> for anyone in the 18-25 years old
age bracket.  Reading the underlined part
of sentence will make anyone over the age of 40 certainly feel tired and
remember “wow this really was the amount of work in the past”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200219223935/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/20-rules-for-your-twenties/">Mid-20s: </a></strong>Once you reach your mid-20s there is a slight change. Instead of working 72 hours productively, you’re likely in the 60-65 range. The interesting thing is there is no change to output, <em>you’re simply much more efficient with your time</em>. After trying hundreds of ideas, angles and projects, you have a much better idea of what won’t work and what will work… This allows you to reduce the number of hours spent due to decision making alone. Again. The actual productivity is just as high, the difference is that you’re getting more leverage from the hours you’re spending. </p>
<p>One of the major reasons why making it early pays off is that you know what you’re good at. Many people do the math and say if you make a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200219223935/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/1-million-10-years-zero-excuses/">million dollars by 30</a>… by the time you’re 50 you’ll be worth $8 million alone just on compound interest. This is the lazy way to think about it though. If you’re able to get to over $1M by 30 it means you are earning a *high* income. All you have to do is maintain that level of income and you’re going to be so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200219223935/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/getting-to-10m-is-inevitable-100m-need-help/">far past $10M the first $1M will look miniscule in comparison</a>. So. By your mid-20s we can say that your hours go down by around 6-8 per week and your energy levels are about the same (if not better). This means the extra time should be spent on 1) staying in tip-top shape to decrease physical decline and 2) building up your second, third or fourth income streams. Both of these items will allow you to elongate your earnings potential. </p>
<p>The real difference here is by your mid 20s you should
already know what you’re good at and what you’re better off outsourcing. If
someone doesn’t know what they are good at by this age they either didn’t
attempt enough tasks or spent their time latching onto the success of another
person. The second one is more common and dangerous than it sounds, by being in
a role where someone supports a winner, they get a lot of benefits from the
rising tide but don’t develop individualistic skills as they are simply
following a chain of commands. Not your problem (hopefully!). Simply spend your
60-65 hours a week on the things you’re good at and keep scaling. </p>
<p>A small side benefit here is that your social life gets a
lot better. The extra ~8 hours a week is a full day out if you want it. The
second big benefit is that you begin to look like an “adult”. Until you’re 25
or so, you physically look like a teenager (for the vast majority of the
population). So you fill out your frame, have more time to go out and if you
don’t feel like it, have more time to read and learn (reading decreases once
the money really comes in). In short, your social life gets better, hours go
down and you don’t actually feel any real changes physically. One thing to
note, you will notice the difference between good and bad quality foods/drinks.
This certainly changes and is your first hint to make sure your diet is “dialed
in”. </p>
<p><strong>Late-20s, Early 30s: </strong>At
this point, the numbers should be working in you favor. The income generated by
your investments and the income generated by your current Company/Career should
lead to significant cash flow. The only issue is that you’re going to be bored
working less than 40-55 hours per week. We’ve seen many people hit their “number”
in their early 30s… quit… only to come back working for 30% less since they got
off the grind too early. While some people are ready to call it quits we’d
wager that it’s a bad move until you’re at least 35-40 years of age. If you
really hate what you’re doing, we’d say to take a longer than normal vacation.
This will be a good reminder that you’re not ready to call it quits as you won’t
have anything to do besides party (which isn’t all that fun 24/7/365). </p>
<p>We’ve got some bad news here in this age range. Somewhere
around here you see a reduction in your “recovery time”. This is noticed both
at the gym and the times you go out to drink more than you probably should. The
soreness from the gym no longer lasts 24 hours but between 48-72 hours if you
really went hard. Similarly, the alcohol consumed is no longer out of the
system within 12-16 hours but instead lasts 24-48 hours killing productivity
for at least one day. The answer will be clear from day one, drink less and
stretch/sleep more. Both of these two items will increase your recovery time
and allow you to physically work out at similar levels to when you were in your
mid-20s. </p>
<p>Since many of our readers are around this transition period
here are several ways to get “over” the hump and make sure the declines are not
felt: 1) chlorella and pedialyte for rehydration and recovery before sleeping
after going out for drinks, 2) penciling in a massage 2x a month to get rid of
any flexibility issues and improve recovery, 3) ice baths and icy hot for
recovery and loosening up muscles, 4) switch from heavy grains like white rice
to quinoa and more legumes and 5) consistent green juices – spinach, kale, etc.
As a bonus, you can also reduce your calorie intake by consuming foods with
high nutrients and low calories: berries and wheat grass while cucumbers can be
used to make your body feel full while simply adding more water. To cap it all
off, make sure your blood work says you have a healthy amount of all the major
vitamins.</p>
<p>Before moving on here, around this age it no longer makes
sense to crank out 60-70 hours a week. In fact, the *quality* of those hours
worked will be low. This is a fantastic way to think about this age bracket. You
should no longer be looking at quantity based approaches and should be 100%
quality based. Your income streams should be high quality versus time spent,
your workouts should be high quality but lower in frequency. And. Your food and
drinks should also follow this same trend. If asked for a single word to
describe this transition it would be <strong>Quality</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>Mid-30s: </strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200219223935/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/list-of-items-to-be-aware-of-for-your-30s/">This is where the energy declines are felt</a>. Instead of working long hours, you should transition into being an “on call worker”. This means you have to focus for short periods of time instead of prolonged focus. If the game was played correctly, you’ll know exactly what to do and have the clearest path from A to B. The downside here is that you certainly see the decline in your ability to stay “on”.</p>
<p>To explain this, back when you’re 25 or so, you could hold
extreme focus for 3-5 hours at a time and not feel exhausted at the end. In
fact, you could hold extreme focus for around 8 hours a day or so and it won’t
make your day to day activities harder. Try to do this at age 35 and you’ll be
forced to cancel appointments. This means it is still “possible” but when you
focus for long periods of time you do not feel 100%. You’ll need to sleep,
relax, and avoid cognitive work. The main transition in this phase is what we’ll
call “cognitive fatigue”. Even if you’ve kept your body in tip top shape, this
happens. For anyone who has made it, they will also notice this lines up with
their experience as it relates to entertainment. You’ll consume a few hours of
mindless entertainment between ages 35-45 because it is something that forces
you to relax. (Side note: this is not a change from prior advice, if you’re not
rich you certainly shouldn’t be watching TV or doing any mindless
entertainment, this is simply how rich people operate once they are older). </p>
<p>Day time activities also jump up significantly in this
general age range. This is because losing large amount of sleep staying up late
only prolongs the recovery period for your body. There is a reason why cities
near the beach cost more (they are a lot more fun during the day). Also. In
this age frame you shouldn’t be stuck in an office and have more control over
your schedule. So you’re able to enjoy the day without impacting your bottom
line. </p>
<p><strong>Late 30s to early
40s: </strong>There is one thread that seems to keep coming back at this age, some
new obsession with food/drinks. If the person is single or married it really doesn’t
matter. Both groups seem to shift to a focus on food and drinks as their form
of entertainment. The ones that do it right are the ones that still look
muscular. This is due to increased focus on energy levels. You’re looking at
another ~5 hour degradation to intense focus per week. Unless you’re on special
“enhancements” which we’ll cover in our upcoming lifestyle/spending book (due
out end of year). </p>
<p>The great news about this age range is that you still look
very good assuming you didn’t develop any serious health issues. Also. By this
time you’ve likely had at least one serious health issue (a broken bone, tendon
damage etc.). This will emphasize the importance of what is going in your body
and how your body reacts to specific supplements. Seeing a professional
dermatologist is essential as well to prolong your youthful look (we’d
recommend going to serious professionals before turning 35 as it pays to prevent
the issue earlier in time).</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating the Time: </strong>After
the entire overview it’s time to go ahead and assign value to each year of your
life. Meaning, by definitions above, since you had *more* energy in your 20s a
lot of those hours can be devoted to making money. By contrast, by the time you’re
40, the amount of “good hours left” in your life is moving down. People can say
what they like but it’s the truth, energy levels decline and the value of your
time should only go up (since you’re closer to death than before). </p>
<p>To attempt to take a mathematical approach to this, we’ll go
ahead and assume you’re working 250 days a year. This means each day is worth
at minimum $400 from day one (250*400 = $100,000) at age 21. By the time you’re
30 this number should be closer to $1,000 a day at minimum (250*400 = $250,000)
and finally by 40 it should be another double as well $2,000 a day a minimum
(250*$2,000 = $500,000). Now before we math this out, lets emphasize that <em>earning is not linear.</em> You will
be working in *event* based income also known as performance based work. This
likely means that several of your years will be significantly higher than
$250K-$500K. </p>
<p>The math is quite simple though, if we take the above
numbers and combine it with the idea that your ability to work goes down, it
means that a year of effort at age 21-25 is worth roughly 5x that at age 40.
Thinking this through it means that every 1 year wasted in the 20-24 age is
equivalent to wasting 5 years straight at forty. Compounding is brutal when it
works against you. Assuming that you’re healthy and in amazing physical shape,
maybe we can reduce this math a bit but not much more than 3 years. Essentially
a single year wasted when they should be invested is worth a minimum of 3x in
the future. Remember this rough metric when deciding to kill yourself working
long hours at age 35-45… the return better be sky high. </p>
<p><strong>Before closing it up,
we’ll have a Q&amp;A on Friday April 19 with the same format as usual. Also. As
stated here it will likely take until the end of the year to finish up our
lifestyle/spending book which will include how to use performance enhancing
items (hint, don’t do what everyone else does and use them when you’re only
20). </strong></p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>I think this article confirms that joining the military at a late age (29) was the right move for me. May sound completely counterintuitive, but the reality was I was on a path straight to average in my 20s. When I get out, which will be around 32-33, I fully understand I have to play catch up, but at the same time, I’ve got a lot more discipline. You don’t get some magical discipline superpower in the military, but you just learn how to deal with stuff that sucks. I fully understand that I’m going to be sucking working hard hours in my 30s. Oh well! It is what it is.</p>

<p>“Everyone in their early 20s is drunk. They are partying in some way and going nowhere as they spend their entire paycheck every month. The funny thing is that their productivity at work doesn’t even take a hit as a person this young can easily party 3-4 nights a week without any hit to productivity.”</p>
<p>First Part is So True, but for the second part to be true your assuming that average fresh grunt work graduate 45-65k a year is productive during the day. Maybe two hours or so? Lol</p>

<p>Spot on.</p>
<p>This article also highlights the opportunity cost of delaying getting your shit together.</p>
<p>A guy who begins getting his finances/fitness in order at 20 vs. 22 will see exponentially better results when their 40s hit.</p>
<p>Ex. I know people from college who already have obesity-related knee problems at 26, massive debt, etc.</p>
<p>I took action a bit quicker and am in the best shape of my life and just paid off my student loans.</p>

<p>As someone who missed money and time management all these years as I was working and doing what I loved, now in mid-50s, I try a lot of these ideas and the light went on.  Missed out on investing and suck at it now but on the sidelines for the next downturn.  One thing I did get right from 24-54 was travel, travel and more travel and never worked 9-5. Only did contract and freelance.  Made good money and took great care of my health and yes, dermatologists are important.  Would love the wallstreetplayboys to also address 50+.  Love reading these articles.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Your software sales post was a game changer for me, got my life straight although I got into it at the age of 24. Before then wasted away “youth” in depression, answering to overbearing evil psycho parents with a stranglehold on my life, and not doing what my skills wanted me to do. Needless to say I did not spend my early 20s or even my college days partying, meeting women, or going out.</p>
<p>Just the past year moved to NYC from a dumpy traditional city full of losers.</p>
<p>24 to now (26, turning 27 in November), I had some fun with drinking, meeting women through dating apps, and partying but I feel like there is still a lot left on the table there. Surely a different path for a late bloomer compared to a guy who got it out of his system in college.</p>
<p>Think your friend Good Looking Loser said to commit a year or so of your twenties to getting laid, meeting cool people, maybe working as a bartender or at a club, and “getting it out of your system”. I think there must be something to this because for me, while I see the importance of sacrifices, I know I won’t be able to concentrate as much on a side business or another source of revenue when I have FOMO running through my mind.</p>
<p>That is what makes the 20s so rough, the fear that you know you have until 30 to really make big life changes but at the same time, these are supposed to be the decade you can have the most fun experiences to look back on. At the same time you also have this decade to accomplish your biggest life goals.</p>
<p>Life after 30 feels like a drag to be honest. You’re too old to fit in with the party people and don’t have as much energy to dedicate to your goals.</p>

<p>Given that:</p>
<p>– It is harder to make friends<br/>
– Almost everyone around your age has wife and kids type of life<br/>
– Your energy levels are lower<br/>
– It is tougher to fix much of anything or turn your life around<br/>
– You can’t party as much<br/>
– You will look odd even if you could party since younger kids occupy that space</p>
<p>I’d be interested to see how is better after 30.</p>

<p>So pretty much none of those are issues if you are actually successful except the fourth bullet but then we don’t care about those people. “Life’s losers”. </p>
<p>Just imagine being 25 but being rich and free to travel and do whatever you want. You can party just as much and out compete because you go out on weekdays not like the regular losers who rage only on weekends when their bosses “let them”</p>
