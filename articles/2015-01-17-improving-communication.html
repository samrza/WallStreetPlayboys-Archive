That said, we have already made another major change. We’ve shut down the Ask Us Anything Section. Why? The questions have become redundant and blog traffic has increased… Materially. While most would view this as a positive… it is certainly not. We want the quality of both questions and comments to be high, while limiting the number of useless questions from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815003123/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-loser/">average people</a>. If we keep the quality high, other writers can promote their blogs/businesses in the comments section and we can continue to solve problems.</p>
<p>Below is a detailed walk through on how to improve communication on the blog. Note, direct and to the point communication is not good for building friendships/relationships with women. This is entirely related to obtaining more value from this blog. We do not want to invest more than a few hours a week, so lets improve the efficiency.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions on the Blog</span></strong></p>
<p>To reiterate, we shut down the ask us anything section since we have answered most of the questions in the past. This means that the reader was too lazy to dig up the information. There are only ~150 posts and it would take less than 15 minutes to track down the information you need on the blog. We are happy to answer intelligent questions, not redundant ones. Finally, to make your life easier we are going to create a more organized archives (again this is a process) and update the FAQ to replace the ask us anything section.</p>
<p><strong>How to ask smart *career* questions:</strong> Some of our readers make $100K a year in the oil sands and others are already millionaires. There is no point in comparing these two groups of readers. Instead, the more important question to ask is “how do you get value from this blog?” The answer is to outline your situation is 2-3 sentences… <em>Max.</em></p>
<p><em>Example of a Dumb Question: </em>“Hi, should I start my career as an accountant?”</p>
<p><em>Example of a Smart Question: </em>“Hi, I currently have $10K in student debt and my best job offer is to become an accountant for now. I want to work in Investment Banking. Should I take the position or wait it out and try to break into a front office Wall Street Role?”</p>
<p>The first question is a waste of time and we won’t answer them going forward. First of all, accounting is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815003123/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-choosing-a-career/">not a career</a> since it does not generate revenue and second, the person did not bother to offer context. The second question is significantly better because it offers context in an extremely <em>concise</em> manner. For the second question, we would tell the reader to take the position *for now*, ask to be placed into transactional services (most related to Investment Banking) and continue interviewing on the side.</p>
<p>Notice, if it is your best option, you have to take it. This blog is about maximizing your options and potential not about useless discussions surrounding “prestige”.</p>
<p><strong>How to ask smart *dating* questions: </strong>Similar to the career layout, we don’t have an interest in answering questions that are uninformed or laced with complaints. If you are going to ask a question you need to have a baseline of experience in the field.</p>
<p><em>Example of a Dumb Question: </em>“How do I approach a girl at a bar?”</p>
<p><em>Example of a Smart Question: </em>“I am comfortable approaching girls in bars and during the day but seem to have a hard time getting an actual date. I have no problem getting a phone number but they just don’t have an interest in meeting me later. I am well dressed and in shape but can’t seem to get a date lined up via text message.”</p>
<p>Similar to the career questions, we won’t answer the first question going forward. The implied message from the first question is this: <em>the person hasn’t even tried yet. </em>If you can’t get yourself to say hello to an attractive girl you’re just another loser who needs to be motivated to do something. Anyone who needs to be motivated is by definition a loser because he didn’t want it in the first place. Are you going to die when you say hello to her? <strong>No.</strong> So go do it.</p>
<p>If this is someone you know, cut them off entirely and tell them to go waste $2,000 a day at a motivational speaking seminar. They are probably dumb enough to pay for the continuity program as well!</p>
<p>The second question? Much, much, much better. He <em>actually wants to get a date.</em> He has made progress with a few girls but is still having trouble converting to the actual date. Also the question says he is using text messages. Now we have a solution.</p>
<p><em>– Don’t text, use pictures/snap chat or 2) call</em></p>
<p>We solved part of the issue. If the person comes back? We would ask: “How did you pre-sell the date?” If he goes blank… it means that he never gave the girl a reason to look for his picture message/phone call in the future. Pre-selling a date means you find one common interest and use that as a spring board for meeting up later.</p>
<p><strong>How to ask smart *personal finance* questions: </strong>As many of you are well aware, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815003123/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/personal-finance-advice-on-the-internet-is-bogus/">personal finance advice</a> on the internet is non-sense. It primarily focuses on saving $5-10 on meaningless items… <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815003123/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/get-out-of-the-middle-class/">at the expense of your time</a>. We will have no such questions on this blog. If you want to try and save $5 on your cell-phone plan or $50 on your next flight, you can leave this section of the web and read frugality blogs instead.</p>
<p><em>Example of a Dumb Question: </em>Should I live with roommates or alone?</p>
<p><em>Example of a Smart Question: </em>I have an industry background and want to work in X industry for investment banking/private equity. I have a few scholarships to X, XX and XXX schools and also no scholarships to XXX and XXX schools. If my goal is to break into banking/private equity which school should I choose?</p>
<p>The first question is a waste of time. If the person has a brain he can answer this question before he even asked it. If the person does not have money in the bank, the answer is to live with roommates. If the person has a high income, then he should live alone to improve his social life. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>The second question is much better because it is a financial/career decision that the reader is juggling. <em>The person has options.</em> In this case we would simply dig up information on the industry and find out which banks recruit at which schools to give him the bare minimum MBA to break into the space. Once you are on the job, your performance matters over a piece of paper so the research is needed before taking on debt which can be a life altering decision.</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Remarks on Questions: </strong>Here are the key takeaways to asking smarter questions: 1) ask them in 2-3 sentences maximum, 2) if you don’t have options you don’t have questions, 3) if you don’t have any experience you cannot have a meaningful question and 4) if you need motivation from us or anyone… this blog is not for you. <strong>You already lost.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comments on the Blog</span></strong></p>
<p>We have a few trolls posting dumb questions and comments on the blog. It is far easier to delete them and move on in the future. In fact? We answered most them. We let them stand because it feeds the SEO and the blog has grown enough at this point (we’re not that dumb – wink wink). Positively, we want the comments to be filled with smart people and we’re more than happy to let them promote their blog through their username. With that said lets take a look at how to leave better comments.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion Comment: </strong>In our post on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815003123/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/frugality-is-a-feminine-quality/">frugality being a feminine quality</a>, there was one person who actually understood the post:</p>
<p>“<em>That’s why only 1% of the population are self made multimillionaires.</em></p>
<p><em>Frugality wants you to be content with yourself and spend more time trying to get more out of your current situation AKA Frugality wants you to trade your potential for your current self.</em></p>
<p><em>Frugality wants you to know that good enough is good enough. But good enough is never good enough when you’re running a business. You have to constantly evolve or else competitors will beat you by copying your product and making them better. You have to constantly pay attention to details or else your employees will slack off and deliver shit to your customers.</em></p>
<p><em>Frugality is like trying to be a body builder but only eating very little to save up — LOL good luck!” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815003123/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/frugality-is-a-feminine-quality/#comment-46937">– Recent Graduate</a></em></p>
<p>This is probably the best comment on the blog since its inception. If people continue to leave comments like this (that clarify or expand upon a post), we can guarantee other readers will click over and read his blog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clarifying Comments: </strong>No one can write 4,000+ words where readers won’t have any questions at all. The key is to pin-point the confusing piece of the article.</p>
<p><em>“In your previous tweet you said happiness is in the thoughts not belongings. When does one truly get happy following your advice?” – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815003123/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/the-definitive-guide-to-doing-the-opposite/#comment-47535">happyadvice</a></em></p>
<p>This comment is fine. You can see the real issue is that the person still associates hard work with unhappiness. This is a major theme of the blog. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hard work is</strong> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not hard work when you enjoy it.</strong></span></em> The person asking this question has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815003123/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/you-are-taught-to-be-poor/">a negative association with money</a>. We are happy to clarify these questions in an extremely blunt and direct manner. Why? We don’t want any mis-communication.</p>
<p>The funny part about this writing style? If you talk directly to people and give them the answer they *need* not the answer they *want* they assume you are unhappy! This is the world we live in. Before assuming that the person you are talking to is unhappy you should ask yourself “Is this advice improving my life?” Then you’ll realize that it is better to be punched in the face with the truth than kissed with a lie.</p>
<p><strong>Promotional Comments: </strong>Of course we love the success stories. We get emails all of the time and it is great to know that an article or comment has changed the way a person thinks. The funny thing is that most people ask us to keep their information private because they don’t want anyone to know they read the blog! Hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Remarks on Comments: </strong>In an ideal world, the comments will be full of people who are trying to achieve something and we won’t have the masses posting up useless information. Going forward we will keep a closer eye on the questions and comments since we want to keep the growth of this blog at a manageable level. Here are the key points to leaving solid comments: 1) expand to help people understand the message – or drive traffic to your biz/blog, 2) post a clear argument against the article that is backed in truth not feelings or emotion, 3) let us help you by pin pointing areas that need clarification and 4) everyone loves success stories.</p>

<p>1) most people are not wealthy enough to invest directionally or with single securities. Most readers are in their 20s/early 30s. Simply put, if you couldn’t accumulate enough money to cover your living expenses, you don’t have the right to  tell a ceo how to run his business. If you can’t manage your own finances, how can you tell someone more successful than you to manage his? Makes no sense.</p>
<p>2) it is much easier to just dollar cost average. You can focus on building businesses and your own skills without wasting 20 hours a week to eek out an extra $10K in earnings.</p>
<p>3) most of the questions we get on wall street deal with transactions. Investment banking/private equity which have practically nothing to do with individual securities analysis. It’s sales/transactions, chasing fees.</p>
<p>4) If a guy in his 20s has $200K or so in net worth… One wrong move that moves him down 10% ($20K loss) now takes a 22% return to make up assuming the market moves up 10. That’s is an enormous loss for someone who has to work for a living.</p>
<p>5) yes we do invest in much higher risk ventures  but again… You do not have the right to do this until you are financially independent. So until our readership changes (if ever) the goal is to make sure people don’t listen to scam artists telling them how to get a “10x return in a year”.</p>

<p>Yes sir. Post to come. </p>
<p>If someone can motivate you, you are not interested in your own future.</p>
<p>In addition, all of motivation is to get you to “feel” something. 9/10 times this means you’re about to be sold something you don’t need. </p>
<p>Never do anything based on emotion.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>Like WSPB said, motivation is a transient emotion. Motivation is merely an emotional state that CAN inspire you to do something you WOULD like to do.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to get motivated to do something, start by cutting out bad habits. Remember, a habit is something that is done UNCONSCIOUSLY and REGULARLY. If you stop browsing Facebook, reading sports articles 24/7,  watch TV, etc. (I was guilty in all of these bad habits) you will instantly be freed with 2-3 hours a day. Next, try your hardest to start a new habit that will enhance your life, such as reading intelligent books or going to the gym. Now you will improve on yourself a little bit each day if you keep up with the habit(s). No need for motivation here, just free yourself some time and then you will instantly have a need to do something useful AKA you either do it or you’re just going to be staring at your ceiling. </p>
<p>But this is just 2-3 hours of your day you might say…. Exactly how does one stay motivated all the time? Well, you just scale that 2-3 hours up to your 16 waking hours. Eliminate bad habits at work, school, lunch, bathroom, bed, car, train, desk, outside, inside, etc. Fill all the newly freed time with positive habits…or better yet, a purpose in life. How to find a purpose in life? try 1000 things and maybe 1 or 2 will entice you enough (credit to Mike from Danger &amp; Play).</p>
<p>And thanks for the accolade WSPB. I don’t have a blog at this time and I probably won’t until a few years later because I haven’t succeeded yet. I’m not going to be a fake expert and make money off of this, not going to sell my soul. I’ll just be reading/replying/commenting for you guys. Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Hey. I turned 18 a few months ago and thanks to your blog, I’ve turned my life around. I had been bullied throughout school and that left me broken and feeling worthless. (High school was over two years ago). It made me disconnected from reality. I’ve literally spent hours everyday just doing nothing and wondering what it’d be like to be a manna/anime hero.</p>
<p>But in the past couple of months, I’ve joined the gym and gone there 4 times a week consistently, improved my social skills (still a virgin but working on it), cutdown on negative loop shackles (ongoing), read 3 books, studied harder and fared better, travelled alone and taken my life seriously once again. </p>
<p>But for whatever reason I can’t seem to shake off the wounds left by my fellow classmates in the past. I’ve tried Google for help but “accepting it and moving on” hasn’t helped. I think it’s like a weight on my shoulder that I can’t seem to shake off, and is slowing me down. I plead to you to do a post on getting over bullying. ( I do this because you mentioned being bullied in a previous post and now you’re seemingly doing good).<br/>
I don’t know whether you’re reading this comment out or it had bene lost in the ocean, but for opening my eyes back into reality, I thank you. Godspeed, Sir.</p>

<p>Been there, done that. Reported the lead bully in middle school who racketed the wrong guy (me). Instant pariah for the rest of my scolarship. Being friends with me meant stolen pens, being beat up by the other bullies, etc.<br/>
To shape your personality alone and develop social skills at such an important stage of life is definitely a big challenge (not the biggest, there are more to come, trust me).</p>
<p>I’d say keep an unshakable faith in yourself, you WILL make it, look at what you’ve already accomplished in such a short time. But don’t believe my motivational comment right here. Keep doing, keep accomplishing, sooner or later you’ll realize by yourself your worth is not defined by what others say.</p>
<p>In short, keep going. I wish i was you, discovering the truth (red pill?) at such a young age. It took me a decade of wandering around to end up on this part of the internet and start turning myu life around. You’re lucky. Make the days count.</p>

<p>Interesting topic (may be worth a post). The reality is that you should channel that feeling of insecurity (being bullied by a person) into more drive to succeed.</p>
<p>The best revenge is success. When you’re rich, happy and dating the girls you want… You’ll get much, much, much more hate.</p>
<p>Consider this training grounds. Life gets much harder. It’s a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Just remember… Repeating… The best revenge in the world is success. Never getting back at anyone.</p>

<p>I am still in high school and I have been bullied during middle school. I was really funny and talked with the ladies back then now I feel like if I say something, someone will just say Bullsh*t. I have been in the gym for around 4 months and improved my physique a lot. I will keep doing what I need to do to improve.</p>
<p>Just one question probably sounds dumb.</p>
<p>I currently have no work experience but my biggest dream is to be financially free  with a business. I am currently living with my parents but want to learn a good skills and some balls to get stuff done. Everything starts with one step. Can you point me in the right direction? </p>
<p>Thanks<br/>

<p>Always admired English language for the subtle ways it can give away a non-native speaker. Even if I have been using it for 20 years+.  It tends to be seen as the ‘easy language’ by people across the world.</p>
<p>One thing about the international audiences and your blog is that many things simply cannot be applied to certain locations of the world. However, mathematics and psychology don’t change with geography so every keen reader can create their own methods based on your principles.</p>
<p>I believe it’s worth reading this blog regardless of whether you live in Manhattan or Eastern European countryside.</p>

<p>Then I will just post my question here again. If you think you’ve covered something like this before, please ignore it. I will try to be concise.</p>
<p>Asian came to US for grad school, currently 27, working as risk analyst in a prestigious hedge fund (150K – 200K all in), engineering background. I’m planning to go to bschool this year (got AD from Wharton/Booth/Columbia) and aiming at Tech IBD post-MBA for 2-3 years and VC/Startup later.</p>
<p>But my biggest concern after reading your post is my age. I will be a first year banking associate at 30, with 200K student loan (I know it is a shame: have no saving so far). It is far from the early 30s with 1-2M net worth goal you stated here.</p>
<p>Do you think I should stick to my IBD plan given my age? Or should I go straight to HF/VC/Startup post-MBA (more “event“ opportunity) ?</p>
<p>My main reason to do IBD for a couple of years is: 1. stable pay to pay off student loan 2. build network/brand for flexible career (in case I want to do something else) 3. master sale skills</p>
<p>In the end, I think a MBA article may be valuable to many readers: when should people do MBA/how to position yourself post-MBA/what things to consider as MBA grad.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You should not get an mba. Transfer to investment banking if you already work in a hedge fund role. </p>
<p>You can network in. Do not get an mba unless you are forced to.</p>
<p>Finally, you should save at least 50% of your income this year. That is not a good place to be from a PF perspective. Not trying to be mean, simply telling you how to avoid large loans + payments if you eventually get an MBA.</p>

<p>Hi WSPs,</p>
<p>I have a question pertaining to sales roles in tech.</p>
<p>I’ve read your post on careers and I agree that, ultimately, one has to be in a revenue generation position to quickly scale up (both salary-wise and responsibility-wise). However, I have been looking at various top tech companies (like Google) and their sales, account, and marketing teams are paid well (150Kish) but nowhere near as well as the engineers, who sometimes make double that. Do these companies, therefore, view their engineers as the revenue generators and not the actual sales teams?</p>
<p>I’m not an engineer. I like sales, business strategy, and finance and I’m a senior at a top business school. I want to be making 250K all-in by the time I am 25 or so. I’d appreciate your thoughts on what kinds of sales roles I can take to make this kind of money or if I had best stick to PE/VC to reach this goal. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>1) you can do investment banking year 3 you get promoted to associate and you’ll make about $250 your first year all in (not the stub) – 25/26 years old<br/>
2) you can go to private equity<br/>
3) you can try VC but lots and lots of those positions are not going to pay $250<br/>
4) you can try a hedge fund. Base salaries around $110-130 for a 25 y/o then variable bonus<br/>
5) you go into sales… You have to do your own research, there you are likely low 6 figures + large variable<br/>
6) yes you can do engineering, again your goal is to get a grip of equity eventually or else you are trading time for money and you will lose</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Question about accounting not being a career as non revenue gen;</p>
<p>What about working in practice where business development (increasing firm revenues) is a requirement to stay employed once further up in the firm (later twenties)? Does this fit into your definition of a career? Or does the fact that the service provided offers less value to the client counter act this.</p>
<p>My thoughts are that although pay is significantly lower,  shorter hours means it allows significantly more time to work on building a side business from day 1, whilst still meeting business owners and developing commercial knowledge throughout the day.</p>
<p>Interested to know what you think.</p>

<p>I feel pretty insecure about my innate intelligence. You say don’t worry about things you can’t control, but it’s difficult when most of the top successes are evidently well above average. Do you think it’s possible for someone to achieve big things in life even if their innate “IQ” is close to the mean?</p>

<p>1) yes. A single class or metric is unrelated to literally millions of other skills. Do real research on  wealthy people.<br/>
2) you’re trying to post a video when it clearly says we have an auto spam for all links posted in a comment so we will not review it (waste of time). If words on a screen or a tacky video can change your emotional state then yes it is motivational nonsense.</p>

<p>Currently a first year analyst in IBD in a top group/firm that breeds career bankers (almost all MDs were analyst in group). However, plan is to move  to a HF related position in the coming years. Realize the importance of getting senior guys to go to bat for you when recruiting.</p>
<p>1) How do you go about bringing this issue up with senior guys that wants guys to stay on? Worried that may affect bonus and staffing in the future</p>
<p>2)What year would you bring this issue up (1st year, 2nd, 3rd)?</p>
<p>3) Relating back to HF discussion, any advantages of waiting to recruit as 2nd/3rd years instead of typical 1st years?</p>

<p>1 and 2 no one can answer for you. You either have a good relationship with them or you don’t. If you do, it won’t be an issue. There is only so much that outside sources can help you in terms of your career, asking about personal relationships is difficult without extremely detailed info which you also shouldn’t disclose publicly. You have to pull the trigger yourself when the time is right, you can’t hedge all your bets in life. It sounds like you will be fine to be honest (we assume they already like you, which is a huge, huge, huge assumption)</p>
<p>3) you can leverage your associate promotion to get a slightly higher base pay starting point if you recruit later.</p>

<p>Hello WSPB, I have a question that I think wasn’t answered in the posts or “ask us anything” section. I posted it some time ago but it didn’t appear.</p>
<p>I’ll have my corporate finance master’s degree in 2 years. I know that NYC and London are the big financial hubs, I live in Brussels (Belgium). </p>
<p>Investment banks here are Citigroup, Deutsche bank,  JP Morgan, BNP Paribas (plus Lazard and Rothschild). Taxes are far lower here than in London (no capital gain tax, lower dividend tax). </p>
<p>Is it worth moving to London once I graduate?</p>

<p>No. If you have a job offer you don’t move to a city for no reason. Get a job in your area code if possible transfer when you have a career already.</p>

<p>Thank you for answering, I realize the “once I graduate” was misleading. I wouldn’t move to a city without having secured a job there, I’m not wondering how to get a job in London, though your answer is still helpful. </p>
<p>What I’m wondering is if getting a job in London is better than staying in Brussels (given London’s higher costs of living and taxes on investment).</p>
<p>I listed you the banks that are here in Brussels, I should have precised that I want to work in M&amp;A (and buyside later). So, is the compensation and upward mobility that much better in a big financial hub like London? Is that difference worth living in a country with higher costs of living and taxes?</p>

<p>As stated before we don’t cover Europe so we can’t answer. You have to ask people in the industry in London etc. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>(Note: not going to guess because that is unfair to you, go and contact people via linked in or via your alumni network)</p>

<p>is paying 100k-160k worth it for education at a target school  if going to school at univesities in my state (university of central florida,university of florida,florida state) will be a lot cheaper because of state scholariships that will pay for 77$  to 103$ per credit hour.</p>
<p>Funds:<br/>
My parents set up a 15,00$ mutual fund for my college,and i am going to apply for various scholarships.  lets say i have have 20-28k in money to pay for college.</p>
<p>for me it looks like the obvious choice is the instate education,but  im conflicted because e of opportunities the target schools will give me access to. essentially the question here is student debt worth going to a target school?<br/>
 I remember it being 2-3 years as being the maxtime its worth it. If you still would hold this guideline for someone who plans to work in wallstreet then how did [authors of this blog who came from middleclass families]  go to market schools.</p>

<p>excuse me for the spelling errors, was pretty dumb not to proofread better..</p>
<p>do you guys wanna increase the readiablity of the comment section,and make it easier for you guys to understand what people say?<br/>
Might want to try adding an ‘edit’ button so people can fix spelling errors,or correct the wording of something if they realize its something already asked,or they weren’t specific enough.</p>
