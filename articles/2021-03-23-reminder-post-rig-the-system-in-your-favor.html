<p>Sometimes it is good to take a step back and realize who frequents this blog. It is primarily younger men in the band of 20-35 or so, the only reason the age band expanded is because of the long history we have here. That said, one of the key things we try to keep in mind is that the average reader is still “trying to make it”. So. We can put up a brief summary of what we’d do if we were starting all over again. Luckily a lot of the things have not changed. </p>
<p><strong>Good Ole Career Stuff: </strong>While education will be disrupted long-term (VR class rooms etc.), we’re still several years away from full disruption based on what we’re seeing. People still view degrees from Ivy League schools and other top universities as valuable (status signaling mechanism). Therefore, the same strategy applies. Get into the best university you can without incurring debt (or any real amount of debt). You can then start working part time jobs while at school and obtain internships. </p>
<p>Most of you are past this stage so that leaves you with three options: M&amp;A banking, Technology and Sales. At this point the clear winner is technology. If you can get any remote job in technology you’re in a great position. Tech is most likely to be “ok” with remote employees and they pay quite well. The second best option is likely M&amp;A banking. This is close to sales but the reasoning is as follows: no travel. If you can play the politics game and work efficiently, you don’t need to work 80 to 100 hours a week. Better to work at a Tier 2 investment bank than a sweat shop like Moelis. The $30K difference doesn’t matter because you’re trying to start a second income stream. Finally, that leaves us with enterprise sales. This is practically equal in attractiveness in our opinion since the income is similar and work hours are much much lower. </p>
<p>So there you have it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210326113617/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/efficiency/">much hasn’t changed from Efficiency,</a> which gives you a deeper explanation of how to choose your skills and what industry you should go into. </p>
<p><strong>Bleeding the Career Dry: </strong>One of the problems with high achievers is that they want to be the best. This is a death sentence for you in the corporate environment. The #1 performer gets slammed with extra work and makes maybe 5% more than the #2 guy at the junior level. Both guys end up getting promoted anyway so there is no need for this type of competitive craziness. </p>
<p>Your goal: do the bare minimum to get the promotion. This means you have to pretend to care about the industry (politics, sucking up to the few people who matter) and you have to do good enough work. That’s really it. If you know that 5/20 people get promoted you want to be #3/#4. If you’re exceptionally good at playing this game you can target #5 but the first go around… #3/#4 is safe. </p>
<p>Broadly, when someone likes you they don’t want to blow up your weekends as much. When someone likes you they will also give you a little bit more leeway when it comes to your work product as well. Again. The goal is to skate into the next slot without doing much work. The problem with being a bottom performer is that you will be forced to do even more work (they will treat you like garbage and make up things that don’t occur – hence why politics are so important). So better off playing the game “good enough” and moving on. Politics &gt; performance and don’t let some boomer or 18 year old tell you differently. People have huge egos in these massive organizations with extreme amounts of bloat.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done this well, you can implement operational systems to appear busy. Good examples are time stamped emails that go out late at night. Automated products using software. Fake conference calls to free up time – point to headphone and say “sure 30-45 minutes”. So on and so forth. This frees up time for you to move to project #2!</p>
<p><strong>The Second Form of Income: </strong>You don’t need much, you just need validation. Again. Most high achievers are risk averse due to massive amounts of social pressure. So you can start small if you’re really scared. Start reviewing resumes for people or doing some cheap consulting service. Once you realize that online income is possible you then move into affiliate marketing, consumer sales or otherwise. The goal is to build something that earns money 24/7/365. Even if it’s only $10 overnight. That is still better than $0 overnight. Then it’s just a scale game.</p>
<p>This sounds easy but it isn’t. Anyone selling you $200 courses on getting rich is scamming you. It’s not that easy. It is hard, difficult and grinding work. You have to figure it out and honestly some people never do. A bit of luck helps.</p>
<p>Once your second income is up and running you want to make sure it is stable. Stable by definition of this blog is around 2x what you make at your career/job (remember a career is where you’re paid by performance, job is anything hourly wage). Once you’ve successfully reached 2x your income you can quit… Or see the bleed it out part below.</p>
<p><strong>Bleed the Career Out: </strong>Everyone has a different “success arc”. This means some people can make a killing in year one and make $1M online out of the gate. Other people struggle to make $5K a year and it takes them 10 years to figure it out. We’re not here to discourage either person. Eventually you do figure out a way to make a secondary form of income and it pushes you along your road to financial independence. The key is “when”.</p>
<p>If you knock it out of the park on day one, you should just quit. It is clear that you’re an anomaly. If you’re in the second camp and it takes you 5-8 years to really figure things out, you should take a calmer approach to your decisions. If it took you 5-10 years to figure it out, there is no reason to leave your career if you haven’t taken your foot off the gas. If you’re a middle of the pack employee you’re actually important to a company. Anyone who is generating operating profits for the firm is an asset. You just want to find a way to improve your operating margins while reducing your time.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is with a slow fade approach. For example, if you work in sales you want to simply maintain your best clients and give up as it relates to finding new ones. There is no reason to get new clients since your goal is to drop your working hours. Once your revenue is stabilized (ideally the same amount every year), you can play less politics and drop your take home pay by 10-15%. You won’t get fired. You will be seen as someone who “hit a wall” and just stagnated. This is perfect for you since you only need to make the same amount of sales and spend the rest of your time on your own projects! Keep this in mind. </p>
<p>The only reason you should quit entirely is if you’ve knocked it out of the park or your career is hindering your side income. This is quite rare. If you’ve successfully built something over 5-10 years, is is much more likely that dedicating 2-3 more hours will lead to more income. So you’re already increasing your exposure to your side income without giving up the steady pay check. </p>
<p>If you want to visualize this, imagine two business lines with revenue streams. If you invest more R&amp;D in the second one you might be able to keep the first business line flattish for the next few years without any time spent!</p>
<p><strong>Another Level of Optimization: </strong>If you work in tech you can also attempt to outsource work that you’re supposed to do yourself. This is actually happening all over the place. Unfortunately, we were never able to do this. </p>
<p>If you work in tech, you can take 2-3 jobs and simply outsource them for a lower amount of money. Then you review it and turn it in to the 2-3 people you work for. This sounds “shady and questionable” however, this is happening all over the place. We know of a few people working three “tech jobs” and no one has noticed. Since the majority of the work can be done in 15-20 hours per week, if they outsource it and simply check… they are done with 35 hours a week or so. It’s insane that this much inefficiency exists in the market but COVID-19 and work from home really highlighted it. </p>
<p>For those that are not in tech you should continue to think like this. If you are able to get a second income stream up and running (even barely), you can then begin outsourcing your own work. If you’re in the 23-29 age band, there is a zero shot that all of your work is “necessary”. A lot of it is mindless which you can outsource. This frees up more time to scale your second income stream. </p>
<p><strong>Pause and Zoom Out: </strong>People in highly competitive fields focus far too much on “prestige” when they should be more focused on productivity. Since we have a banking background we’ll give a concrete example. If you have the choice between a sweatshop like Moelis or a solid BB with less work, you should choose the solid BB. If you are in the industry for more than a year you will find which groups have easier hours and simply lateral over to that firm. Why? You’re not there for an extra $20K. That’s the dumb way to try to make it. </p>
<p>You’re there to be top bucket, be around 10-15% of the highest paid people and work 20 hours less. Those 20 hours will build up a second income stream so you don’t have to panic before your annual bonus hits. The standard move on wall street is to spend your base salary and save your bonus. This is why they end up becoming miserable as a 5 year career will have a terrible bonus year at least once given the secular decline of the industry. </p>
<p><strong>What to Do With Your Money: </strong>Well we gave out highlights in our book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210326113617/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/triangle-investing/">triangle investing.</a> It’s effectively the same except for a much more bearish outlook on real estate due to 1) evictions starting in April/May and 2) the likely tax target aspect since it’s easier to tax RE. There is no way we could have predicted a global pandemic and we certainly got lucky predicting a recession by 2021 in our book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210326113617/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/spending/">Spending for Maximum return</a>. </p>
<p>That is neither here nor there. As usual we focus on the present. All that really happened is that triangle investing accelerated. Crypto is taking off, Tech is taking off, healthcare is taking off and we remain positive on the other markets we highlighted there. The only thing we would do is reduce real estate footprint if you have a lot of it. Since most of our readers are young we’d recommend the same: 1) rent to remain mobile or 2) if you found a place you love, it’s best to only have one spot and keep underneath 18btc (also known as $1M USD token). </p>
<p>The rest of your money is going to be put into your online income ventures . While everyone is absolutely hyped about the future of tech, we would like to remind everyone that having multiple forms of income is most important. Hence why we created this post here. Remember to play the game intelligently and all your free time will then be tossed into the investment angle highlighted in Triangle Investing. </p>

<p>Banks are zeros and we should be investing only in crypto, absolutely agree and on it. Hypothetical question though, in 5 years when netwoth has mooned and banks are crushed, what will be generating cash flow?</p>
<p>You’ve always said cash flow is king and again, absolutely agree, but what are your plans on generating consistent, good cashflow from millions in BTC/ETH/STX etc?</p>
<p>Or do you expect options for that to develop as the crypto industry matures?</p>

<p>The WSP response to this is either NGMI or “read before posting”.</p>
<p>Holding crypto will generate cashflow in several forms. Direct staking, stacking, or lending or with services like Blockfi. Other options will include renting out your NFTs, collecting royalties on music and artwork, or renting digital land in metaverses. What comes next? More of the above.</p>

<p>What do you reckon is the right amount of income to target for the 2x online. Sometimes the job pays well at $500k+ so doing 2x at online might take far longer (or never to reach $1m per annum) than someone earning a $50k junior role and quitting at $100k of online. I would suggest that the $50k is too low, while the $500k income might mean you’re too deep in the corporate world already, but unless you’re doing way above 60 hours at the job just keep it? Interested in the thoughts rather than the simple 2x relative?</p>

<p>I work in the medical field and since WSJ are positive on healthcare, will add in nurse practitioner. Much shorter route than MD, and unlike physician assistant, can practice independently dependent on state.<br/>
Get the $100k job 4 days/week, then telemedicine side biz right from the home office. Start up expense is minimal, malpractice being one cost.<br/>
Above route does involve graduate school (time), something to consider as a secondary option.</p>

<p>I know not Q&amp;A but missed the last one and would greatly your thought as I’ve been following for years and finally broke through with online biz. You can delete this + IDs</p>
<p>Great post. Currently in the “bleed dry” stage yet on track for promotion (enterprise account executive). Only reason I might not quit is because of the experience/skills I would learn that might pay dividends 5-10 years down the road when building a bigger biz. (Closing deals, negotiating major contracts with suppliers, joint venture negotiations, etc.)</p>
<p>Is this a valid reason to stay on for at least a few more months, or would you have pulled the trigger if already making ~$15K/mo profit from online biz?</p>
<p>Cheers. Banks are zero.</p>

<p>depends if you have an issue with having an employer or want your own time? If your employer gives you complete freedom then perhaps not. If you still report to an employer you don’t have time freedom. Also, nothing lasts forever – so a new boss might change your view.</p>
<p>On the biz, at a certain point you might decide to sell the business anyway and live off investments that don’t require your day-to-day involvement.</p>
<p>Just depends on your circumstances, your own risk profile, and how much income/wealth you have.</p>

<p>Slightly lower as I’m still new, but more upside I guess. And probably not, but it’s pretty nice to have that in the bag if you’re pursuing a barbell strategy around online biz. Pay probably scales up to around 220k without much more work. </p>

<p>I consulted to government for 15 years and don’t recommend government work to anyone. You’ll most likely end up working for and with people who moved to government for the easy lifestyle and lack of accountability, as well. With a lazy boss and colleagues you can end up doing all the work for zero recognition and zero extra money.</p>
<p>Other negatives: lower potential salary, less talented colleagues / internal clients, plus once inertia sets in you may lack the confidence and initiative to get out, and be stuck there until you retire.</p>

<p>I made a similar move <a>15 yrs</a></p>
<p>– As for being unfireable; the goal is to make you stay which is so much worse if you think deeply about it.</p>
<p>Long term risks of dong this:<br/>
-Who you associate with will affect you, Gov jobs(in majority) attract the lower end of talent pools, self-explanatory.<br/>
– If you want to go career, certain gov jobs will automatically limit you going private sector after.<br/>
– I takes you out of touch with reality. I see a large disconnect/contrast while operating my business.   </p>
<p>So why did move:<br/>
My goal is to get rich in the most efficient and legal way possible so this job meets the requirements that I needed(for now), more as a component of a system, rather than a career choice. As well, I will not be going back to work for anyone after this.</p>
<p>Do I recommend that you do this:</p>
<p>No,  Unless this a temporary move to fulfil a larger goal(business, getting rich, etc) where the job gives you complete autonomy, you aren’t tracked*(Almost all are – director level and under) and you can work remotely, I wouldn’t even consider, if I could do it all over again, I would not have gone this route. </p>
<p>Working tech sales will keep you sharp, you will get more money, stay in touch with the actual economy and be around winners.</p>

<p>Interesting, thanks for the response. I live in Can/NZ so it seems like government salaries are too high and sales/private sector paychecks are too low. </p>
<p>But yeah I agree with your points, at the end of the day I just need something  to pay for the roof over my head while I focus online.</p>

<p>Been reading your blog since 2015 at age 30, just wanted to say a big thank you for your content and calls (crypto, trump), it’s changed my life. (not from USA).</p>
<p>Grew up extremely poor, managed to study Software Eng &amp; Maths at a decent institution. Graduated near bottom of class, was an average student at best (poor discipline, lack of guidance). Never got a good job out of the gate, didn’t make decent money until 5 years in.</p>
<p>6 years go networth ~$100K, extremely frustrated, was bad at playing politics, life sucked. Came across your blog and I instantly knew everything you said was truth. Started a side hustle in real estate development (essentially an LBO). Working 60 hours per week in day job.</p>
<p>4 years ago networth ~$300K, pulled the trigger on second real estate project, got better at playing politics, reduced work hours to 40 hours per week in day job.</p>
<p>2 years ago networth ~ $700K, began third real estate project, work hours down to 20 hours per week in day job.</p>
<p>2021, networth ~ $1.2M, still in real estate projects, work hours 10-20 usual weeks with spike upwards sporadically, surprised I haven’t been let go already. Also started ecommerce site on track for $150K first year revenue. Targeting $2.5M networth by 2023.</p>
<p>Wish I discovered your blog earlier, best time to start was yesterday but the next best time is today 🙂 Politics &gt; Performance. </p>
<p>For younger readers start as soon as your can, swallow your ego and get all of WSP’s books and read down to the last details, all of their content is gold!</p>
<p>Peace out, grateful for your blog.</p>

<p>Even before covid I had 2-3 high paying tech jobs where I did as you said, outsourced the work and I just reviewed, pushed their code as my work and communicated. With one of them I had three months not producing ANY noticable work, I was honestly just waiting it out to see how far I could take it expecting to get the boot. One whole month all I did was produce a diagram! At one point the COO wanted to talk with me (~100 people org), I thought hehe this is it. “Hey H, give me a reason to write you a big bonus” Lol. He gave me a big perfomance based project which I again outsourced.</p>
<p>I did eventually quit as they got on to it and my own business was replacing that income. Still have 2 tech jobs that are mostly outsourced (NY based pay)</p>

<p>2 things I’d like to contribute:</p>
<p>1. You are 100% correct about people in tech outsourcing their work. My buddy’s uncle works in tech in NA and outsources his work to 4 guys in a smaller country in Europe. He pays them each $25/hr and profits over $1000/day off them alone, not to mention the other side projects he has going on. Even better, the 4 guys who get paid a $25/hr live like absolute kings in their country. Win-win.</p>
<p>2. This industry isn’t as hot as it was 20 years ago but one of the most underrated fields would be mutual fund wholesaling. In essence, you work at an asset manager and you call on independent financial advisors to get them to buy your companies Mutual Funds and ETFs to use in their retail clients portfolios. At the AE level (where you meet clients in person), people would rake in 500K-1m+ a year just by being likeable and throwing lavish events. </p>
<p>Now due to secular decline, you’re raking in 250k-500k (can get to this level by age 25-26 if a killer) but involves a lot more consulting on the markets vs. just being likeable. What’s advantageous though is that it’s been found (unsurprisingly) that the AE role can easily be done at home (amazing for side biz).</p>
<p>Also, at the inside sales level you can be making 80k-160k 1 year out of school. Not amazing money but good for someone that went to a non-target, got poor grades but can sell and has an interest in investing. The environment is fun too as everyone you work with is also extraverted/likeable, of above average intelligence and ambitious.</p>

<p>“At the AE level (where you meet clients in person), people would rake in 500K-1m+ a year just by being likeable and throwing lavish events.”</p>
<p>Desire to know more intensifies. I’m going to do some research on this. I could see a demand for crypto investment funds, like Morgan Creek or others. I get it that tech is a lucrative path, but after getting smacked pretty hard with some computer science classes in school, it’s more of a hobby than something where I have a real skill that I can make something out of, whereas I legitimately enjoy finance as something fun and not just chasing prestige or money. Maybe I’m weird but I actually do find financial markets interesting.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip.</p>

<p>I’d encourage you to search up mutual fund wholesaling on Wall Street Oasis forums and you’ll learn everything you need to know about the work itself and compensation. It’s a super lowkey industry so it’s tough to find even basic information on Google.</p>
<p>I believe selling crypto funds will be the next big thing and am legitimately looking into starting a business that helps crypto fund providers distribute their products to financial advisors and retail investors. Could be incredibly profitable but would also be insanely tough to set up. You’re definitely on the right track with the crypto thinking but getting your feet wet at a traditional asset manager first would be a good idea as well!</p>

<p>For the enterprise sales folks out there: Transitioning from a hunting to a farming role is a move I am currently executing. Basically going from AE to customer success/account management. your upside is lower (20/80 split or so vs 50/50) but seems like work is way lower at alot of firms.  </p>
<p>Now I’ve got a question if anybody has any experience to answer – building out an instagram/youtube page for your brand for organic traffic, waste of time for a first time brand builder or worth the sweat for organic traffic?</p>

<p>If you’re already FI (covers expenses and fun, but not rich), small side biz, and got laid off during Covid from high-paying career, do you:<br/>
a.) get another high-paying position, keep building the side biz till decent size,<br/>
b.) use all this time to scale the side biz (now primary biz) as your expenses are already covered by FI? Might take a while to scale, so opportunity cost is the lost cash from the high-paying career, but potential to spend 100% of time on the biz. </p>
<p>Want to keep build the FI cashflow now to be rich, not just a replacement for a work income. Rather go for a or b now post FI with tons of time?</p>

<p>Bleed it dry people! Milked 15 months out of a corporate analyst position working an avg 6-10 hours/week. Did have to amp it up once in a while for large projects but that wasn’t the norm.</p>
<p>Automate your work. Make it seem time consuming. Don’t send an email at 5pm, schedule it for 9pm. Get a computer dock that allows you to switch machines quick. Don’t post on social media, and if you do, don’t let work peeps see it. Move time zones, and take advantage of the time change (Managers weren’t awake for 2 of my 8 hours!!!). Politics are also key.</p>
<p>Finally cut bait as I could sense a massive project was coming soon and I had zero interest taking it on. At this point my side {primary} income was 2.5x corporate slops and it was a no-brainer</p>

<p>Or worse – work like a dog and then realize at year end you got passed over for promo / top tier bonus due to politics and don’t even get the extra 20k you chased all year anyways.</p>
<p>I had this happen to me 5 years into my management consulting career – was ticked at the time but I’ve come to realize it saved my life – quite literally. Been following the slow fade approach ever since (going on 3 years now) and actual results have not differed. Meanwhile – more time for side hustle – and more money as a result.</p>
<p>Thanks as always!</p>
