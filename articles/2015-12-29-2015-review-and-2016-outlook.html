It has been the best year in history to make money. The best year in history to be single. And. The best year in history to start another company. 2016 is looking better than ever but instead of putting the cart in front of the horse we’ll review the year (both positives and negatives) and move onto 2016 expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>2015 Positives</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Writing Style Established: </strong>We’ve finally established a consistent *writing style* although we continue to mix up the format. Overall, happy with the progress here as the blog was abysmal back three years ago with chaotic content that could have been summarized in a solid tweet. Importantly, with the new and established writing style all of the terrible posts have been turned into solid tweets causing our twitter account to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter Use Solidified: </strong>We’ve also established the point of the blog and the point of the twitter account in 2015. It will continue to be a micro blog about topical items and will *not* be used as a “connect” feature unless we get bored. Running a micro-blog is more helpful and we won’t waste our time dealing with trolls. We’ll continue to build our own audience separate from any sort of “movement”.</p>
<p><strong>User Base is Up: </strong>We’re on the line here with creating our first product. Yes it will likely be an information based product but we’re not going to sell anything until our metrics are hit. Will it make us a lot of money? <strong>No.</strong> The blog continues to grow and we make a lot more money elsewhere (Wall Street is not our primary source of income). In short, user base continues to grow at a nice clip despite materially lower post count.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>2015 Negatives</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Decline in Posting Rate: </strong>To no surprise to our readers, an actual company (or companies in this case) and a career is significantly more important than a hobby blog. This blog took a massive hit in posting rate and we’ve tried to ramp it up now that things have cooled off. Disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>Still Arguing With Failures and Losers: </strong>We wasted time arguing with people on the internet and even more-so in real-life. While the rate was down a solid 50% we’re going to try and decrease this again by another 50%. If a person is too slow to figure out what is legitimate and what is not, we’re simply going to click ignore and move on (we’ve already met multiple people in real life including some of our excellent commenters!). Mediocre people *practically* never turn it around. It is much more efficient to find someone who is above average but younger… than find a fool in his early 40s and $200K to his name… Sad and pathetic.</p>
<p>They had 40 years to figure it out, while there is still a “chance”, the probability is so low it is not worth your time. Hat-tip to Felix Dennis for that one.</p>
<p><strong>User Base Not High Enough: </strong>While we’ve mentioned this as a positive, it didn’t actually hit our metrics. Both a success and a failure. If we were able to keep the posting cadence up we would have been ready for a product launch already! However. The user base increased more than expected given that were only posting 1x per month! In short this was both a win and a loss for 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>2015 Articles We Didn’t Write</u></strong></p>
<p>Since we failed to post as many times as we wanted we’re going to highlight interesting articles from 2015 that we didn’t write! Here are some interesting posts we read while in transit.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730035959/http://mikaelsyding.com/exhausted-by-resting/">The Paradox of Rest – Mikael Syding:</a> </strong><em>“If you want something done, give the task to a busy man. Ask somebody with all the time in the world, and it will take exactly that long”. </em>This is probably one of the best quotes we’ve read and it is entirely true. Resting is not limited to sitting in front of a TV screen or taking cat naps. Resting is really a form of changing tasks in your brain. Using this blog is a great example, it’s fun, we don’t take it seriously and it activates the creative part of our brains.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730035959/http://www.dangerandplay.com/2015/12/27/how-much-money-do-independent-authors-make/">How Much Do Independent Authors Make? – Mike Cernovich:</a> </strong><em>“Every author keeps their sales data secret because of an “embarrassing” reason.” </em>In short, Mike outlines the e-book industry and gives you an idea for how much money you’ll make by being an author. It isn’t great. People write to us asking if we’re “hating” on the sales and the answer is always <strong>no</strong>. We actually <strong>*agree*</strong> that writing online is definitely not the best way to make a living <em><u><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730035959/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/what-is-rich/">if you want to make money and get rich.</a></u></em> In fact, his sales numbers are incredibly impressive. Generating $100K as a one man shop selling e-books to a market for *men* is no joke. We wouldn’t even sell a fraction of that based on his data! Read the article before you believe you’ll get rich selling books and stop complaining that he has monetized 10+ years of effort.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730035959/http://www.dangerandplay.com/2014/08/04/5-meo-dmt-spirit-molecule/">5-MeO-DMT, The Spirit Molecule, Pineal Gland, Consciousness, and Atheism – Mike Cernovich:</a> </strong>We actually feel uncomfortable posting that link here, which is exactly why it belongs here. There is no reason to add an explanation, when you read or listen to the post you will believe what you believe and we will all move on. Yes we realize it was written in 2014 but we found it this year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730035959/http://30daystox.com/how-to-write-a-sales-letter-for-your-blog/">How To Write A Sales Letter For Your Blog – Robert (30 days to x)</a>: </strong><em>“It will take you between three to five years before you figure out how to actually make any money. Most niche sites will cap out around $15,000 a year. If a website is earning more than $30,000 per year it’s almost always operating off of paid traffic. The owner is <strong><u><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730035959/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/money-making-machine/">buying advertising space somewhere.</a></u></strong> Sites that get organic traffic and less than 10,000 visitors a day aren’t going to earn a more than a $10,000 to $20,000 per year.” </em>Simply well said and true. This is why we aggressively hammer the point down of needing *paid advertising* to make money.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730035959/http://illimitablemen.com/2015/12/27/machiavellian-maxims/">Machiavellian Maxims – Illimitable Men</a> </strong><em>“When people don’t like you, their questions are attacks. Sometimes these attacks are disguised as concerns, other times they are blatant. Whenever you’re asked a question, judge the legitimacy of the question. Insincere questions must be met with insincere answers, if any answer at all.” </em>This post is almost a darker refresher of the book 48 laws of power. We usually do not like list posts but this is a solid summary of the dark side of human nature. We found this blog this month and will check it sporadically.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>2016 Expectations</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>No Q&amp;As for the Masses: </strong>We made this change in 2015 (for comments) and it was probably one of the best decisions we have ever made. <strong>Going forward we will only provide Q&amp;A’s to <u>**email subscribers**</u> and they will be held on Twitter on a Monthly/Quarterly basis depending on schedule. </strong>We are shutting down the free-for-all Q&amp;A’s on Twitter as too many of the questions are terrible so we never respond. Importantly, for every single subscriber you will have significantly less people to compete against.</p>
<p>– Facebook will be the first place to receive post updates</p>
<p>– Twitter will be a micro blog and also provide post updates</p>
<p>– Subscribers will receive access to Q&amp;A’s and we will respond with @ instead of .@ to minimize interactions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730035959/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/what-is-a-regular-person/">with regular people</a></p>
<p><strong>Continued Page Growth: </strong>We have three triggers in place before we start a product to sell. Page views, users and email subscribers. If the three triggers are hit we’ll get started. Until then we’ll keep steady with the stream of information/content.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Final Comments</u></strong></p>
<p>On a personal note, reading took an enormous hit this year so we were unable to 1) read as many books as we wanted and 2) were unable to read as many blog posts as we wanted as well. With that said we’re happy to hear about interesting posts/books that people found in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***No Questions Allowed They Will Be Deleted***</strong></p>

<p>Thanks guys for the post, love all your content! While generally I do agree that doing the opposite is the best practice, I feel after a long year going out on New Years eve (and not dragging it for 3-4 nights) is not the worst thing in the world.</p>
<p>I had one major setback this year semi out of my control: boutique bank I was at ended up paying a analyst bonus much less than expected (for all junior bankers) and it really hurt since it felt like a year wasted towards net worth. Working on pivoting and moving, but turning this into a positive frame has been hard since I’m almost 25. </p>
<p>Will reread some of your posts to help! </p>
<p>Happy new year</p>

<p>Thanks guys. Know much worse things have happened in this world, but have been debating the merit of switching banks at this point in my life versus going all in on a business and going to a “less hours job”. I can probably guess your guys answer.</p>

<p>Yup. If the bank will promote you, you’re almost forced to stay.</p>
<p>If the bank cannot, you gotta jump.</p>
<p>You’re only 25 you can do both assuming the biz is online.</p>

<p>When you switch banks you basically take a year back.</p>
<p>So if you were going to make $200K then $250K as an associate you would jump then be forced to be at $175K followed by $200K (analyst 2 and 3) *and* you have to start the political process alllllll over again</p>
<p>The political piece is an enormous risk since 80% of people do not get promoted at each level. People disregard this and believe promotions just happen… *They don’t*. </p>
<p>That is why associates have an enormous age range of 25 all the way to late 30s.</p>

<p>Since this blog post is very much in the spirit of the season, I wanted to say thanks for all the posts during the year. It’s been both helpful and motivational. </p>

<p>I just want to say thanks for 2015. I discovered this blog around October/November of 2015 and I agree with everything thing you said. Instinctively I knew what you said to be true about dating, finances and self but beforehand, I was drinking the Kool-Aid from ‘regular’ people. I read (and own) a lot of the books you recommend *before* I knew you: Models, Closing the Sale, Ca$hvertising are some of the ones I read and been implementing in my own journey for self improvement. This blog refined my viewpoint and I dropped quite a few things based on the (winning) ideas within. 2016 is going to be f’in amazing 🙂</p>

<p>I have a few runner ups but my favorite one is The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco. </p>
<p>Here are my top personal highlights from the book:</p>
<p>– “Without process, there is no event.”<br/>
– “To consume richly, produce richly first.”<br/>
– “…If you aren’t where you want to be, the problem is your choices.”<br/>
– “Value your time poorly and you will be poor.” </p>
<p>So when I came to Wall Street Playboys with this in my mind, and other ideas I never expressed (i.e. the man has all the power in dating/relationships simply because he chases while women waits), your blog was right up my alley to finally get me to get off the Woo Woo juice.</p>

<p>We have not saved anyone. No information is “life changing” that is marketing nonsense.</p>
<p>You have to find the problems yourself and solve them yourself. The only real helpful piece is no longer drinking the kool-aid and realizing the best way to make money is through sales, Wall Street or the valley. And. Of course. Topping all that is a company.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t worry about the user base. Quality &gt; quantity. </p>
<p>The market for winners was never going to be huge anyway – which is a positive, more money left on the table for us to grab!</p>
<p>Also as a response to the “books are undervalued” tweet: “1000x return”… how about the free **actionable** advice on here..</p>
<p>Would’ve been nice to have a bullet point on Trump in the “2016 Expectations” section but understand that it is not always the best idea to focus too much on politics (leave it for people who want handouts in life)</p>
<p>Echo the point other readers are making about how this blog has completely changed one’s mindset. Thank you!</p>

<p>Happy new year guys</p>
<p>Just wanted to thank you, this blog has changed so many dumb ideas and has really opened my eyes </p>
<p>Things like whining and complaining now seem so childish. I’m beginning to *really* improve my emotional control and that alone is a *major* positive.</p>
<p>I’m very grateful for this  blog and for Bridgewater principles by Ray Dalio ( self made WallSt. billionaire). Amazing that both give so much value and are free </p>
<p>Thanks again for saving my youth</p>

<p>“Third, we continue to get questions about doing an Internet Marketing post. No chance. We make more money online than we do on Wall Street (all writers in revenue generating roles) so there is no way we are ever going to give that information out. People on the internet copy and steal things that generate $20K a year so there is a better chance of us blowing our brains out. Positively. Here is a book that every single person must read if they want to learn how to sell online: Ca$hvertising. It is basic but gets you started.”</p>
<p>You’ve already given out more than enough. After seeing your stuff about IM at the beginning of the year, I started looking into IM in May. Bought my first traffic in June, fast forward to December I finally cracked $ x,xxx/day. Already making more with IM than my other business.</p>
<p>Doing a different traffic type and vertical than you (what I guess you’re doing), nevertheless you got me started.</p>
<p>When I found your blog 1,5 years ago, most stuff was far out of my world. I thought that you guys cannot be real. Hah…how fast things can change!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Nice, we’ve given enough information out where anyone who makes money in online sales will know our rough income and vertical. </p>
<p>Try to clear $1M this year, if you can go up monthly it is doable starting at a base of 4 figures a day.</p>
<p>We really appreciate the comment since we are certain now we’ve given more than enough information out. No point in creating competition in our own niche.</p>

<p>Any chance we could get an actionable plan on how to allocate your time wisely while staying in on NYE? </p>
<p>I remember a post in the past where you mentioned a lot of the things to look at but I can’t seem to find it anymore! It was very useful, hope you boys had a great Christmas and have an awesome start to the new year!</p>
<p>Reading took a hit for myself this year as well. I am just now catching up on all of the posts you’ve recently put up. Excited for the increase in post count again! </p>

<p>To add to your note about the blog content improving (which it certainly has):  if you are not embarrassed/disappointed with how you were writing, closing deals, lifting weight etc. in the past, it means you are not improving.  </p>
<p>As an example, when I think back on deals I closed three years ago, there are things I said or did that I would never think of doing today.  Ive worked on my pitch and delivery consistently over the past few years, and my close ratio has improved substantially.  </p>
<p>Touching on your underlying theme of failure, it’s fine to make mistakes as long as you are not repeating mistakes.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>In 2015 I started to learn copywriting after you suggested it. I read “Web Copy That Sells” by Maria Veloso and put the information into action right away.</p>
<p>How I have been practising my copywriting:<br/>
-Freelancing on Upwork<br/>
-My own review site</p>
<p>I know I won’t make much money but that’s not the point. I need to learn as much as I can while I’m young (I’m under 18).</p>
<p>In the future I plan to work in finance but I will be testing multiple side hustles while I’m in High School/college.</p>
<p>I have already improved my writing skills drastically compared to 4 months ago. My goal in 2016 is to start making *a little* money off my site. In the future I’ll have to move on to paid traffic but learning the basics of copywriting, marketing and business has to come first.</p>
<p>This blog has opened my eyes to the reason most people will never be rich (scarcity mindset, wasting hours to save $5 a day) and for that, I am very grateful to you.</p>

<p>Long time lurker.  I’ve never commented before.  Thank you for all of the content over the last year. </p>
<p>I work in finance, but as a software developer, so a lot of your advice isn’t directly actionable to me.  However, I am still a couple of years away from my 30th birthday, and I just cracked the 1MM net worth threshold (before anyone asks, none of it was inherited).  </p>
<p>Looking forward to all of your posts in 2016!  I know you guys don’t do meet ups with mediocre people, but since I’m a winner, I’d love to buy you guys a drink sometime in NYC.  (FWIW I’ve met Sam from FS before, so he knows I’m legit.)</p>
<p>Have a happy new year!</p>

<p>Haha!  It wasn’t a question, it was an offer!  Had drinks with Sam when he was here a few months ago and it was a great time.  The email I used for this comment is not anonymous.  Feel free to look me up on LinkedIn and see where I work.  Trying to be as anonymous as possible with the content of my comments, so gun shy about listing the sub-section of finance I work in here…</p>

<p>Love all of your content. </p>
<p>While I totally understand why winners don’t need motivation. Your posts are like a slap in the face to me which sets me in the right direction. That’s the right motivation. After reading them, I work harder and take action to improve my life. No other blog has had that influence on me. </p>
<p>I remember I used to listen to “motivational videos” and would try to get all pumped up and then sit down and…..read more blogs or motivational stories. LOL. Waste of time. Doing 1 thing on a to-do-list and taking the rest of the morning off would have been a better use of time. </p>
<p>On another note for content, </p>
<p>I would like to see more Game/Life related posts. I really enjoyed the ones you have published here. I really lack that area in my life. Grew up super awkward, but am ripped and tall enough 6′, and will have 2M by next year, and I’m younger than 28, so I’d like to focus on that area of my life. I get laid a lot – about 70-130 lays, but none are with quality women. After reading the book you recommended – “models” I stopped sleeping with these sloppy 6’s, because I don’t really enjoy it half the time and antibiotics suck. I forgot the quote from models, but it’s something like “if you’re sleeping with a bitch, you’re still sleeping with a bitch” lol. </p>
<p>I like the content at Good Looking Loser, but he’s the only “pickup” resource I think is pretty decent. I’ve seen other famous “PUAs” in field, and I really dont want to be like them. </p>
<p>Thanks for the content</p>

<p>This blog is the Howard Roark of the web – an oasis in a sea of bullshit. Your writing is very much appreciated.</p>
<p>There are three “lifestyle” books I consider invaluable to those seeking freedom from the aforementioned bullshit – two of which are recommended on this site  (Guide to Rational Living/Guide to the Good Life). The third book is The Unchained Man by Caleb Jones. </p>
<p>To the men behind WSP – sincerest gratitude and much respect to you all for creating this resource.</p>
<p>Here’s to 2016 being better than 2015, but not better than 2017.</p>

<p>Consistency, 6′ , 28, ripped &amp; worth $2mm , sounds like you should be getting 9s &amp; 10s fairly easy. Otherwise you should create a system that consistenly delivers them. Quick way of determining if you have a working system is if you look at the last 3 months, how many dates did you go on with girls you would be happy with. If it’s less than 10, you don’t have a system that works.</p>
