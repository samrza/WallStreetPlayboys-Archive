</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>Starbucks was a company struggling in 2007 where its Mojo was lost as the company deviated from its core strengths to venture into breakfast sandwiches in addition to invoking other changes including bringing in an automatic espresso making machine.</p>
<p><strong>So what was the problem with this stuff?</strong></p>
<p>First, the cheese from the garbage sandwiches began to overwhelm the aroma of their coffee. Second, the decision to move to an automatic espresso making machine removed much of the romance and theatre that was in play with the use of their La Marzocca machines. No big deal you say? Well in 2007 their stock price dropped from $35 bucks to $20 (40%+ decline). The vast efforts to reform lead to the company to temporarily lose its identity, as focus expanded beyond core strengths.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong></p>
<p>This eventually lead to a change in leadership as the early owner HowardSchultz stepped in to succeed (the then) CEO Jim Donald. Schultz’s vision was to go back to emphasize its roots in producing…fresh roasted Coffee! Shocking (not)! He said “Growth, we now know all too well, is not a strategy. It is a tactic.” The result? The stock went from $20 (at the end of 2007) to a shade under $60 (today).</p>
<p>The franchise’s ventures out of its area of strength resulted in a temporary loss in leverage. <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This same principal applies to managing where you choose to go out.</span></strong></em> As the case with Starbuck spreading itself too thin, you should not over extend yourself in the night scene. In other words, you should NOT be consistently venturing beyond 3-4 of your favorite bars unless you’re attempting to move beyond your comfort zone, you need to have a “go to spot” if you are in a rut. By favorite, we mean places where you stand the best chance of succeeding with the girls/guys you want. These 3-4 favorite bars is your blonde (pun intended), medium or dark roast – its your core strength. The bars you dabble in beyond these represent your<br/>
burnt cheese on the breakfast sandwiches or unoriginal espresso makers – its not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>So how does this work?</strong></p>
<p>Get to know (inside and out) the supporting staff. Bouncers, bartenders, bar backs, bottle service girls/guys. Develop family-like rapport with them – know their names, names of their friends, what they like to do outside of work etc…Offer to buy them shots, introduce them to your friends, invite them to your own social gatherings, you get the picture. Since these people are embedded in the night scene, they are often very entertaining people. Great, so how does this benefit you?</p>
<p>You are now well-positioned to establish status for yourself. This same status equates to freedom from waiting in pretentious lines, discounts on drinks, and most importantly, that you are a central figure. From an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190613235853/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/?p=837">ROI perspective</a>, this is also in your benefit – reduced time waiting in line, lower net costs, and increased popularity. Yes – we are all drawn to people in control – this is an automatic +2 point bump for you. Get ready, your popularity will gradually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190613235853/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/?p=761">snowball overtime</a>.</p>
<p>So what is needed? Guys… showing up to a place with 4 guys is not ideal for any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190613235853/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/?p=582">bar or club</a>. The only exception is if they are good looking, like 7+. The industry recognizes the importance of garnering a good looking audience – they make money from it. As a general rule of thumb, shoot for a 1:1 ratio in your group, at least in the early-going. Once you’ve established yourself, and only once you’ve established yourself, your dependence on girls can subside overtime. Girls, there is no advise here, as long as you take care of yourself, the night scene is your oyster (assuming you’re in the 7+ range, nickels don’t help too much in making cute girls jealous).</p>
<p><strong>Our experience with this?</strong></p>
<p>We have our preferred neighborhoods set up so that everyone in the club/bar knows us. Our<br/>
apartments are in the same zone as the stomping grounds. Our chosen bars are within a TaylorMade’s R11 shot (aka ~320 yards, or .1818 miles) away from our beds. We have built and cultivated numerous relationships over the years with people in the “industry”. Our favorite bars on Friday and Saturday nights have lines that threaten to waste one’s night by 15-45mins. When is the last time you’ve waited in these pretentious lines? We hope it was during the recession in 2008. We show up (with a decent looking crowd), complement or lightly flirt with the same bartenders, introduce our friends to them, and place our orders which take under three seconds. The general rule of thumb in the industry is 3:4, meaning it is ok to give a customer a free fourth drink<br/>
after they buy their third. Our ratio: one-one. This equates to 33% net savings (assuming $10/drink, as 3:4 equates to avg cost/drink at $7.50 vs. 1:1 at $5). So now that we’ve quantified the benefits of time savings (15-45mins) and costs (a 33% off sale), let’s get into what’s most important.</p>
<p>Just last night, one of us had a group of random girls say “you seem to know people here, I can’t believe they just let you in and we have four girls with us.” The group of girls opened me, and this happens often guys. You end up introducing the pack of girls to dynamite drinks not on the menu and ended up taking them to another bar, bypassing the line and actually getting free drinks this time around. The net result? Brought home the Swiss girl in the group, a hard 8.0.</p>
<p><strong>So now ask yourself:“Do I have leverage?”</strong></p>
<p>If not, its time to re-evaluate in the same manner Starbucks had. Stop going to new places if you have not found yourself a home. Hone in on your favorite bars, where logistics are in your favor and begin to build fun, new and advantageous relationships.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>I get the idea  but this doesn’t really help compared to some of your other articles. If I am starting from nothing, say in a new city how is this going to work? It looks like the original assumption is you’ve got a group of friends already?</p>

<p>Make friends. That’s the short of it. We all had to start somewhere and these guys have been doing Wall St for several years at least. Overnight success appears overnight but it takes time. The most important thing is to go out consistently and make good picks for your top 2 locations (they told you exactly where they should be!)</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>This article hits real close to home having worked for Starbucks in college off and on  from 2003 to 2007. (hey they were flexible, and the store I worked at was a chick haven). Everyone knew they were over expanding (“urban” coffee opportunities? Really?) and diluting their product, first with overpriced sandwiches and then “hot” breakfast.  I got a 15% discount on purchase of SBUX and sold that shit off as soon as I got it the last few years.</p>
<p>But enough about the mermaid.  I recently moved to a new major city but not before learning to apply the same principles stated in this post on bars around my home city. It was just beginning to pay off too, having instant cred walking into the 3 bars I frequented and even snagging a few of the bartenders (one of whom was a soft 9 ex ballet dancer). I’m in an even more prime situation now having 20+ bars within walking distance in the new city, that I can start getting dividends from my strategy in days instead of months.</p>
<p>Solid post and rock solid advice that everyone can use.</p>
