<p>Following up on our post of observations, we thought it
would be good to figure out where the next big industries are. Some of the
clear ones have been related to technology: blockchain, AI, Robotics, video
games etc. However, if we take it a step further, we can take advantage of
industries that will boom *due* to the impact of automation/decentralization.
In simple terms, people will gain more autonomy, they will either be rich or
poor and the same mistakes that were easy to recover from in the past won’t be
easy snap backs anymore. </p>
<p><strong>Zero Talent
Industries: </strong>Assuming someone has zero talent, it likely makes sense to
enter the healthcare field at this point. Before we would have recommended
going into housing or something similar where one could flip homes (repair
them) for large amounts of money. When we originally suggested this, we didn’t
realize that many people won’t be able to run the numbers correctly. House
flipping “gone wrong” is just as bad as levering up into the wrong investment.
So. With this new assumption in mind, we’d go straight into health related services.
</p>
<p>Home health type services will allow people to get paid with
limited risk to automation/robotics. You’re not going to send a robot to take
care of an elderly woman (checking her blood pressure, taking her places etc.).
You’re going to send a human being with good social skills which can be learned
over time. Also, by working in healthcare related industries, we’d bet that the
individual would be less depressed. Seeing how hard life can be if your health
is taken away and how grateful people are to be alive is going to prevent your
average person from slipping into depression. </p>
<p>The most basic items we can think of here within health care
are: X-ray technicians, phlebotomy, nursing and home health services. We’re
certain there are many more, we’re just listing a few quick ones that require
next to no education and pay a living wage. The goal here is to find a
profession that allows someone to live a basic life without any special
talents. </p>
<p><strong>Psychologists: </strong>Scale
this idea up and we think Psychologists will become more popular over time.
Look around. People are starting to believe in stuff like numerology and
astrology. They are starting to take their pets on planes more frequently for “emotional
support”. They are suffering from more and more panic attacks as they graduate
from college and don’t have the career they expected to have. All of this points
to more psychological issues in the future. We’re not trying to “make fun” of
these people, we’re simply pointing out the truth. A lot of people are entering
adult life with very little to look forward to so they either get depressed and
need support or they start believing in hope based items like astrology. </p>
<p>If we can agree that people will struggle in early adult life, becoming a psychologist is likely a safe profession. <em>Assuming you’re good.</em> We’ll write that out again. Only do this if <em>you will be good.</em> Unlike standard healthcare professions we listed above, this area only rewards the best people. If you’re able to help someone break out of depression and get their life in order, you’ll be doing them a huge favor while also being paid handsomely for it. You’re not taking advantage of anyone if you’re able to deliver results. Similarly, if you’re not good at it, you won’t get clients and they’ll all go to the small handful of people who are actually talented (just like everything else in life). </p>
<p><em>Key examples: </em>summarizing the two above from the very basics of just x-rays and phlebotomy to scaling it up to psychological help and “life coaches”. The ideal would be a life/psychological coach for people who were born rich but are not very talented. As a note, we actually expect this to be common as rich men become more shallow over time and their mothers are not that smart which leads to “normal” functioning children with a lot of money but not a ton of talent. (yes this is judgemental as we assume the extremely attractive woman isn’t that smart… which is ***GENERALLY*** true. As they say, rich men and attractive women never have to deal with reality.)</p>
<p><strong>Services for the Rich:
</strong>Moving onto the second section, we think the world is moving into two
economies. The well off and the not-so-well off. While people will always make
excuses saying that you need to be born into money to get rich, hundreds of
studies have already proven this false. Since your average person has zero talent
but thinks he’s a genius he’ll ignore all of them and complain that he’s not
getting his fair share. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916005715/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-90-of-rich-people-squander-their-fortunes-2017-04-23">For
fun the math is about 70% off of families lose their wealth by the SECOND
generation and 90% by the Third</a>. (<em>Note
this applies to the USA</em>)</p>
<p>As usual debating with unsuccessful people isn’t a good use of time… instead… time to sell services to the rich! The rich will pay for practically <em>anything that saves them time</em>. Seriously. They will pay for dog walkers (even if they are overweight), laundry, cleaning and of course faster travel time (Clear and Pre-check are popular for a reason). If you’re willing to grind out long hours before scaling up, anything that is “direct to consumer” and related to time saving will work in major cities (San Francisco, New York, Miami, Los Angeles etc.). The one downside here is that it won’t scale past the major rich people centers of the world. That said. Successful D2C services for the rich is a large enough market. </p>
<p><em>Key Examples: </em>Dog walking business, tax filing for the rich – if you worked for the IRS before you have an immediate edge, laundry/cleaning/cooking, direct to home tailoring, shoes, designed clothing… Rich people also get bored and you could even come up with a D2C alcohol product (rich people collect wine and “rare whiskey” is appreciating rapidly) could expand this.</p>
<p><strong>Scale Up the Insecurity:
</strong>As mentioned in the prior post, since the average person is getting more
insecure by the day, it means that we’re seeing a rapid rise in drug abuse
(steroids) and plastic surgery for <strong><em>both</em></strong> men and women. If you’ve
got good sales skills but don’t have the ability to become a plastic surgeon
(without incurring mountains of debt), then you could help create/sell ads for
these services. If you’ve been on a plane lately you have all seen those ads
for face lifts, grey hair etc. This is probably going to be one of the most
profitable industries over the next 20-years. People really believe they are
making a “more secure“ decision by trading the lambo for the face lift and
liposuction. Despite costing tons of money (both options) there is a new trend
to not “flash wealth” so they are moving into body reconstruction. </p>
<p>The “looks” industry is still growing rapidly. While you
want to avoid the whole personal trainer route as revenues fall off a cliff in
a recession, anything related to making people appear youthful is on the rise.
We’re even seeing women in their early-mid 30s trying to go to the high-end
night clubs (unsuccessful). Seriously, a few of them are doing tons of surgery
to try and keep up as they are still single. (hint this is another reason to
get rich and throw those classic house parties or bring your own group of
people to the clubs where there is an unwritten rule of not showing up “empty
handed”). </p>
<p>If you’re talented at sales, then we’d go ahead and enter the mens cosmetics/grooming industry. This is not a troll. If you’re already good at selling womens cosmetics, selling to men in the future is certainly on the table. Instead of selling makeup/skin care you’ll be selling grey hair remedies to insecure men along with facial/grooming products (can also be masks/trimmers etc.). There is a reason why “Hims” is growing rapidly and it has much less to do with the product and has 100x more to do with a shift in demand and marketing. Online dating is still popular according to all metrics, so you could also venture into photography for men as well. Yes. All of this sounds “kooky” but if you look around this appears to be a trend. Trends make money. </p>
<p><em>Key examples: </em>Wide range again but start with trying to help sell expensive items, creating ads for plastic surgery liposuction etc. The most popular upsell appears to be lip injections for women and botox/dysport. Second to this will be hairlines for men and liposuction. If you can help “normalize” more expensive procedures you’ll make a killing. </p>
<p><strong>“Cute Food”: </strong>This
isn’t something we’re interested in as it requires a lot of start up costs
(brick and mortar). That said, when men settle down (around earl 30s) their Instagram
pages suddenly turn into photos of food constantly. Even the guys who are
loving their personal lives tend to do this. We don’t know why but it happens
right around that age and doesn’t slow down (well into 40s). This is also something
that women do all of the time from age 20 and up. There are pages dedicated to “Food
Porn” and other such catch phrases to make everything seem cooler than it is. </p>
<p>What does this mean? Well it means you can create a “cool
experience” around food and charge an extra 100% for it. Does it really cost
$14 to make “organic avocado toast”? No. Does it really cost $5 to make a latte
with a foam heart on top? No. Does it really cost an extra $1-2 for toppings at
your local desert spot? Nope. As you can see it’s all about making it look
cool.</p>
<p>Since budgets will be smaller (not rich category), the average person will spend more on something that looks cool and makes them feel special. On a somewhat related side note, this likely means we’ll see more creative customer service in the future. Could be an opportunity as well. If you can pay your waitresses/servers a bit more but make them do something entertaining to improve the experience it’ll probably pay off. Places like Benihana grew rapidly by offering a new experience and while it has plateaued for now, there are other options (fancy deserts, fancy millennial avocado toast etc.)</p>
<p><em>Key examples: </em>This can range from the most common items like ice cream and pizza to more expensive items like customized cocktails. You can also go the millennial route by offering trendy items like avocado toast and selling sushi. Come to think of it, since people will be a bit more depressed and men will be more upset (“rage”), marijuana is a great industry for the next several years as it will act as a “cure” <strong>and </strong>been seen as “cool”. </p>
<p><strong>Travel Bucket: </strong>We’re leaving this for last since its still extremely popular. As mentioned the new status items are plastic surgery and high quality travel experiences. Since there are two groups here: rich and poor, we just don’t see how anyone is going to start a private jet company from scratch. If you’re balling that hard probably don’t need to read anymore. That said, here are some ideas we’ve been thinking about. </p>
<p>New variety of a travel pillow or lower back support. Since
most travelers will be in economy, there has got to be a way to fix the
experience. If you’re traveling in economy, the way to sleep is by getting a
window seat, placing a pillow on your lower back and angling with your head on
the window and legs in a diagonal direction towards the middle seat. This
maximizes the leg room you’ll get if you’re flying economy. Everyone has to fly
economy at some point unless they’re in the $100M+ camp.</p>
<p>So. Instead of complaining about this, we’ve been tinkering with a seat adjustment product that would be placed on the seat (low back). Currently, trying to test this with various pillows but there is certainly something there. The neck pillows don’t work well since the headrest forces you to lean slightly forward at times (not sure who designed that thing to be so big). Essentially, the key is finding a way to create a “plank” that goes backward so you increase the angle of your body as much as possible. If we can figure this out we’ll attempt to sell it since it would make flying 100x better. </p>
<p><em>Key examples:</em> we gave out one item we’re trying to figure out, but anything that’ll make the flight experience more enjoyable would be huge. Most flights are just terrible for the vast majority, at the end of the day unless it’s an international flight, there are are not a lot of first/business class seats so the regular economy section needs significant improvement. </p>
<p><strong>General Unique Stand
Outs: </strong>This is not related to making money. More general information. Since
we know we’ve moved from “materialistic items” to “plastic surgery and grooming”,
you can imagine that the easiest way to stand out is by doing the reverse. If
you’re sporting a nice watch or expensive shoes you’ll garner more attention
than the person who paid for the improved hairline. This is just due to math as
the trend is to get “cool tattoos” and focus on non-materialistic experiences. The
funny thing is that if you make it to the real top of society (we’ll draw the
line at $5M+ net worth) all of those things do come back anyway (nice clothing,
shoes, watches). So. You’ll be sending a differentiated message.</p>
<p>We needed to make this clear as the trend does not necessarily mean you should “do them”. Instead the trends are there to make you money while you spend said money on improving your personal life. The best example of this is people who sell $50-100 sports jerseys to super fans but don’t even enjoy the sport. Or the statisticians who bet on sports without any interest in the game. Unsurprisingly those two people win the most. </p>

<p>interested you mentioned nursing as it was a career field I had researched previously in the past. One big upside I learned about nursing was the ability to work 12 hour shifts, 3 times a week. As a person with a one track mind it’s often difficult to dedicate “corporate time” to side ventures and having a 4-day weekend seemed great for those purposes</p>
<p>Another low talent career path for people to consider is offshore oil rigging (although a bit more grueling, usually provides more cash).</p>

<p>“Or the statisticians who bet on sports without any interest in the game. Unsurprisingly those two people win the most.”</p>
<p>I cracked up hard when I read that. I got into betting on sports after your first Conor vs Mayweather tweet, knew nothing about boxing, mma, basketball etc.</p>
<p>Took a really unemotional approach to it and it’s been 1 year and I’ve tripled my money! (low 5 figures)</p>

<p>Great article! One quick note about nursing is that there are two basic types: the BSN and the LPN. BSN makes all the money and has a 10x better job, and requires more education. You’re gonna have to go to college with the intention of going into nursing, get a ton of prerequisites, and 2 years of clinicals to get that. It’s extremely difficult to get it after college if you’re trying to balance a job. Doable, but it’s not gonna be a good experience. </p>
<p>LPN you can get in a year with little to no training but you’ll be capped around 45k in most markets with no growth prospects beyond that, so avoid that like cancer. Source: entire family is in the healthcare industry. </p>
<p>Also slight typo under Cute Foods: “early” thirties.</p>

<p>Arent cosmetics things to get cut if someone is getting poor? For example budget for clothing surely gets slashed when poor as you have already mentioned in a previous post. What is it that differentiates cosmetics from clothing (other than female bias towards them since you are talking specifically about male cosmetics)?</p>
<p>You have also mentioned that it is harder to stand out in a group of strangers due to increase in status items bought and that this is probably because we are right before the next economic downturn. Dont you think the increase in male cosmetics might also be a symptom of this? If so it might be temporary and could change during downturn.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing this insightful post. I’m very bullish on male plastic surgery (lefort/jaw surgery in particular). The other trends/ideas definitely make sense too.</p>
<p>In terms of learning to spot trends ourselves (instead or having to rely on this amazing blog), what do you recommend? Or is it just a function of living in the cities you mentioned (SF/NYC/Miami/LA) and opening our eyes?</p>

<p>Funny you mention travel and flying economy.  My wife to be works in the airline industry and we use about the equivalent of $100k/year in travel benefits  (keeping in mind it would take $150k in income to pay $100k out of pocket for flights).  It’s a hell of a lifetime benefit to have!  Even though we have an 8 figure net worth, there still isn’t any way we’d be paying for business class on every single flight we take to Europe or Asia.  Totally changes our travel thoughts when its cheaper to fly to Rome/Paris/Hawaii/Tokyo  for the weekend than it is drive 3 hours away to stay at some local resort type place.  Definitely spoiled when you don’t even consider going if we have to fly economy longer than 3-4 hours, but you do have to be flexible on timing…but that is the whole reason to be rich so you don’t have to be on somebody else’s schedule.</p>

<p>Because we fly standby and just cherry pick the flights that are available for the times we want to travel.  Also, business class domestically isn’t a big deal like it is when you fly international.  It is like having a private jet at your disposal that can take you anywhere in the world, but you have to be patient.  There has been only 1 time in 50+ flights that it hasn’t worked out ideally, oh damn we had to spend one more night on Maui lol.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Psych isn’t good because you have as much education as a doctor (time &amp; money) for significantly lower pay, around $130k/yr.    You can go the ‘NP’ route of being an MFT, but that gets even lower pay and there is even more competition.</p>
<p>If you want to go therapy private practice who only charges out of pocket / no insurance based off your reputation solving the emotional issues of rich people,  I’m not even sure if you need psych training.  Go get MFT for cheap somehow and hustle.  That’s pretty much the only way you can make good money in psych that I can think of.  It basically becomes a derivative of ‘services for the rich’.  </p>
<p>Why doesn’t psych pay as much?  Because insurance providers don’t pay out that much for psych services or visits compared to normal doctor visits.  Stuff like lyra health only pay $30-60/hr.</p>
<p>Also it’s hard to scale as a psych or any doctor.  It’s 1:1 personal service and psych sessions are far longer than 15minute doctor sessions.  The golden age $$$ wise of being a doctor was around the 80s.</p>
<p>I estimate this is case because mentally ill people are not rich people, because they don’t have the emotional or intellectual fortitude to become rich in the first place, so they don’t have as much money to create a high demand market for their services.  While physical illness services is mostly servicing the issues of the old, which is something everyone will eventually become.</p>
<p>————–</p>
<p>Video games is also another bad sub industry of software to go into.  Way too many passionate kids who want to do it, so it’s semi-perpetual crunch time with significantly lower pay than the rest of software.  It was true 20 years ago and it’s still true today.   Most of the extra money it generates now gets thrown at armies of artists, because the art content requirements have gone way up.</p>
<p>————-</p>
<p>I would avoid careers that have a ‘meaningfulness’ or ‘fun’ or ‘artistic’ factor if they don’t make a difference for you.   The reason why is because there are a lot more people who want to do that kind of job vs. ‘actuary’, ‘real estate developer’ or ‘salesman’.  Supply and demand sets the labor market price as result.</p>

<p>Poster is correct that yearly is faster and “good” pay. Friend is a therapist, masters, but simply discussion boards. Makes 160k as a therapist employed by google.<br/>
For psych you have to go primary care (FNP), then pysch which is hard and take 8 yrs.<br/>
You then can bill $200/hr in private practice so 400k min. Sell the practice 4x revenue, rinse repeat, Long road though, faster ways<br/>

<p>I also think low skill labor like home help for the elderly will not be high pay, partly because today it’s mostly imported laborers already and because shit like this is on the horizon:</p>

<p>Even if AI never delivers, I think we can deliver people in india doing many of these basic jobs for $300/month</p>
<p>The wealthy elderly will get the nice people, the non-wealthy ones will have no choice but to get the robot.</p>
<p>In general, you will want to avoid things that will make you “below the API”, like an Uber Driver.   So dog walking might not be that lucrative, but a dog walking business, with employees, would be.</p>

<p>Can absolutely agree on the psychologist part. Although different health system (CH), top 5 in my area, in 2 years have no availability for new clients, will turn practice (5 other psy) into joint-stock, fine-tune the offer (more lucrative).<br/>
Younger and younger clients, men of all ages- more life-coach as standard psych work.<br/>
Surplus is invested in real estate of course.</p>

<p>funny about being less emotional about the games and sports betting. when i 1st started sports betting it was all about my favorite teams and players and i would always lose. Now i just look at numbers and common sense and detach from the games. i rarely watch the games live and ive won more $$$ my last 4 years than ever</p>

<p>Regarding “cute food” I first heard about it at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916005715/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/" rel="nofollow">https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/</a></p>
<p>I think it’s fascinating, and sad.</p>
<p>Anyway, please keep doing these posts, they’re amazing. They’re a glimpse of the current reality in metropoleis like NYC/London. Especially useful for us living in small places trying to understand how life is evolving and what’s coming. </p>
<p>Regarding man beauty products etc, this is a company that I’m aware of and you may find useful : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916005715/https://www.manual.co/" rel="nofollow">https://www.manual.co/</a></p>

<p>“you can imagine that the easiest way to stand out is by doing the reverse. If you’re sporting a nice watch or expensive shoes you’ll garner more attention than the person who paid for the improved hairline.”</p>
<p>Been doing the opposite, and spent a couple thousand on clothes. The ROI is insane, and I have really started to notice fashion. It’s crazy how bad people dress.</p>
<p>While the women are alot more open to me.</p>
<p>I am getting a TON of salt from male peers/friends they really hate it.</p>
<p>What to do?&gt;</p>
