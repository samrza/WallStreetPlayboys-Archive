</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>To say that 2019 has been busy is nothing short of an
understatement. This year relative to last year has caused far too much
economic activity. It feels a lot like 2006/2007 hence why <em>new money</em> we’re getting is not being spent buying stocks or
bonds (no we never sell or trade since it just isn’t worth the mental hassle). All
that said, we figured there couldn’t be a better time to talk about extreme
levels of productivity. Our up-coming book is going to have information that
will only resonate with people who eventually make it to the top (not people
who are now upset with this blog since the average income has gone up 250%).
With that we’ll jump in.</p>
<p><strong>Overview 2019, Too Much Money Sloshing Around</strong></p>
<p><strong>Money First: </strong>In
times of high economic activity you want to do two key things: 1) focus your
energy on the biggest opportunities and 2) start giving up those hobbies
temporarily. While writing is fun and cool since we get to see the 1% make it
and laugh at the people making $200K a year who will be out of jobs in less
than a few years, it just isn’t a priority. This becomes harder and harder as
your hours ratchet up while you think “Do I even need the money?” As soon as
this question comes up you know you’re in a period of too much activity.  Essentially, you’re losing respect for the
amount of effort it took to make it somewhere so you’re thinking about taking
the “easy” route which always ends in tears. </p>
<p>When we say money first we mean you’re going to work like
you’re 23 again for at least a year. High economic activity means too many
people have too much money to waste. This is going to put strain on a lot of
your personal relationships. But. If they are close friends they’ll understand
that you’re not going to be going out 3x a week anymore and it’ll fall to the
classic <em>“1x at most, see you Saturday”.</em>
</p>
<p>Now we’ll define “Money First”: calculate how much each
activity should yield on a daily income basis (holler at those affiliates who
correctly learned to think like this earlier!). Even if you have to travel all
over the place to close a few sales, you should go ahead and do the death
march. It’s all about probabilities to close and you’re going to throw all of
that “partying money” into a driver, late night flights if needed and of course
the classic “driver pick up” where you pay the guy to get your food as you move
to different locations (have no time at all). If the value of the sale is going
to equal more than 1 week of income (based on your current daily intake)… you’re
working all week, all night, all year until that calculation breaks down. </p>
<p><strong>No More “Heavy Nights”:
</strong>This is probably the worst part about high economic activity times. You
actually can’t pull those 4-5am party nights more than 1-2x a year. Seriously,
it just isn’t possible. You’ll wake up and lose 48 hours worth of productivity
which could have then (by the calculation above) bought you 2 weeks of income
or 4 weeks of investment income at minimum (anyone reading this will be
investing around 50% of their income). Even if you were 40 years old, it doesn’t
make any sense to lose 1 full month of investment income for one “fun night out”.
The only way it could possibly make sense is if your passive income was higher
than $1M/year after taxes. </p>
<p>So the biggest way to prevent this productivity loss is to
say no to all of those big parties. This will absolutely test your will power.
Anyone who makes it in life knows that private events are the highest quality, highest
return events as you don’t have to worry about ridiculous things like “paying for
a drink at the bar” or having to “look through the crowd” for someone decent
enough to talk to. Either way. The unfortunate downside to “making it rain” for
a year is that you’re going to ditch a lot of the fun <strong>*temporarily*</strong> as you’re essentially purchasing 4-years of fun
during the next down turn.  </p>
<p><strong>Normalized Activity: </strong>Before
moving on, all of the items we recommend below are for high economic activity
years like 2019, 2013, 2006 and 2007. They apply to any type of economic
environment… That said… We’ll emphasize that these extreme measures are only
needed for high economic times. If you’re in a standard year (normal), continue
to go out and have tons of fun 2-3x a week since the number of money making events
will be limited and doable with 5 days of effort per week. </p>
<p><strong>Extreme Prioritization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Workouts Take a Hit: </strong>It
really can get this bad. If you are in a time of extreme stress you will not be
able to work out properly. You’re going to be forced to improvise and go into
what we call “preventative workouts”. This means you’re trying to max out your
workouts and minimize the declines. If you have a full month of money making,
we predict your physical fitness will decline by about 10%. This is not
terrible but it sure beats most people who would fall by 30% as their VO2Max
would drop off a cliff (no running for a month causes a catastrophic drop). So
here is the best way to workout in a hectic week where we assume you only have
a total of 3 hours to work out. </p>
<p>3 Hours turns into four days of working out. That is about
45 minutes each. It is smarter to do this with 30 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour,
1 hour. During the 30 minute workout sessions you will be doing reps until
failure. The whole “workout routine” is dead. Dead. It means that you just don’t
have time for a full workout for 7 straight days. So you’re going to choose
only four exercises: Cardio, back, chest, legs. Forget everything else.</p>
<p>The 30 minute days = lift weights until failure on each rep.
This is for back, chest or legs. You’re going to take a weight slightly lower
than your normal weight (5% lower to prevent injury) and you’ll do each set
until failure. Rep after rep. If you can get through 4 different exercises, you’re
crushing it. Then depending on if you’re a night or morning person you rack up
the body weight exercises: sit-ups, pushups, dips until failure just before you
jump into the shower. This is of course extreme but allows you to extend the
workout without losing valuable time. </p>
<p>The 1 hour days. Essentially you want to do at least a 40
minute cardio activity. Once you go over 20 minutes the body realizes it’s a real
workout so when you push to 40 minutes twice a week you’ll prevent a step down
in cardio declines. For the remaining 20 minutes you do the other body
exercises you missed. Since you have 3 hours in total, you’re going to have to
do back or chest before or after the run. Our own recommendation is to do the
run up front (counter intuitive) since you’re typically so exhausted it is easy
to quit the run early and say “oh I have to go back to work”. </p>
<p>That’s a brutal 3 hour work out while traveling around
managing a 100 different things at once. It doesn’t even include your regular
work but it’s 100% possible to still crank out 3 hours or so even if you’re
living based on flight times. (extreme pro-tip, airports have yoga/meditation
rooms where you can stretch if your flight gets delayed. You can also do basic
workouts there in a corner and just hit the lounge for a shower). </p>
<p><strong>Pack as Light as
Possible Idle as Little as Possible: </strong>It isn’t enough to pack the minimum.
You want to pack the minimum in order. When you open up all your bags when
going to meeting or the hotel, everything should be organized in the way it
will be brought out. If you have clothing that will be used on day 4, it should
be at the bottom. The older used clothes should be towards the bottom (or
bottom compartment) so the rest of your items press down on the used clothing
(doesn’t matter if they get wrinkled since you’re not using them again). Think about
everything you’ll pull out of the bag. Your bag will be different but once you
think about this in detail once, organizing in the future will be like clock-work.
Extreme situation, if you have specific liquids you need to carry, go on amazon
and buy as many “travel sized” plastic containers as you need and they’ll allow
you to save space versus calculating everything for each trip. </p>
<p>On the idling side, this is where having a driver is
critical. If it’s a really jammed day where you have to move around fast, the
difference between Uber Black and a driver is the ability to never sit around waiting
for food. Have it ordered, eat and drink in the car and you’ve just saved
yourself 1-2 hours. Uber’s slogan is “everyone’s private driver” but we all
know that it really isn’t the same if you’re truly busy.</p>
<p><strong>Low Quality at End of
Day: </strong>You know those emails that make you cringe when you respond to them
because they barely even clear your ROI? This is where you finally get to
ignore them. That’s right! The one benefit of being legitimately ultra busy is
you can laugh at all those smaller non-needle moving events and answer them in
2-3 sentences dead last at the end of the day. Ideally, you’ll actually win a
few bigger accounts and you can delete them forever! Just thinking about this
will make a huge smile cross your face, nothing like having someone you barely
care about get upset and switch only to find out it’s because you landed
something better. It’s kind of like running into an ex-girlfriend and she sees
you with someone 100x more attractive (awful to say out loud but everyone knows
that feeling)</p>
<p><strong>Everything Gets
Turned Off: </strong>You’re going to run out of energy. There is just no way to
expect to be “on point” every single time you are trying to ramp up production
of something or make a new sale. A good way to combat this is the “zig zag”
strategy. You want to have the first 3-4 hours of the day be important, the
next 2 hours be less important (lower money opportunity) and the last 3-4 hours
be highly important. This causes you to take a “break” as your brain gets a bit
of a rest in the middle. </p>
<p>As a note, during this time you should actually avoid
responding to personal life items. This sounds ruthless as well but unless it’s
an emergency just tell them you’ll respond end of the day. Yes. We realize this
makes it seem like personal relationships are on par with a mediocre customer…
While true in terms of time dedication, your personal relationships should “get
it” and not cry about your delayed responses to their random messages. Also if
you give them a heads up they are 100x less likely to care, they know this
happens and will be understanding. </p>
<p><strong>Stagger the Caffeine:
</strong>You’re going to consume caffeine. Unless you’re against it for religious
reasons using caffeine is going to put you in the “right mood at the right time”.
If you up the Caffeine dose before the first 3 hours you will be in a fantastic
“on mode” for the important meetings. This will lead to a moderate crash during
the less important meeting (zig zag). So think about changing up your intake to
match when you should be paying attention. As you know, we recommend coffee
with butter if you’re going to be in some sort of long form conversation. This
would mean you’re going into a single long meeting for 4-6 hours of focus for
something extremely important vs. smaller shorter meetings. For those really in
the know, we also mean stagger with two meanings here (covered in book so no
don’t ask what, if you know, you know)</p>
<p><strong>Read Read Read: </strong>This
is what travel is for, reading and preparing for what needs to be said the next
day. This can either be actual information or it could be soft information. Is
the guy an avid Democrat? Don’t be stupid, leave the republican cufflinks in
the bag. Did the guy get married early with limited life experience? Don’t be
stupid, wear the boring trustful color of blue. Did the person recently get
divorced and wants to go out a lot? Don’t be stupid, line that meeting up last
so you may convince him to go out and party. Essentially, don’t go into any
meeting with the same material. You’re just being unproductive with your time.
Those low quality customers that you’re responding to are actually causing you
to lose money (substantial amounts of money). Oh and of course, always choose
the window seat. It’s always easier to sleep in versus getting bumped in the
aisle seat by a random person walking around (aisle seats are just terrible). </p>
<p><strong>Extreme Organization</strong></p>
<p>Quick recap, you’re going to have 1) no more meaningless personal
life conversations unless it is serious, if it’s serious all “work” needs to go
on hold – death for example but we really doubt it will occur, 2) you’re going
to zig zag the important items, adjust your caffeine intake and do a painfully
efficient three hours of working out and 3) you’ll turn off all devices hit the
window seat and either prepare or sleep. </p>
<p><strong>Food and Drinks: </strong>You’re going to be busy so you actually want to think about what you’re consuming through the day. There is a zero percent shot you’ll be able to eat something amazing mid-day so this means breakfast and dinner is where you’ll line up something extremely healthy. Also. You want to drink a TON of water in the morning since you’ll be dehydrated within a few short hours. It’s fascinating to see how poorly the body operates when dehydrated and if you’re not drinking at least 32-48 ounces of water the first 30 minutes in the morning. You’ll pay for it quickly. Sounds extreme because it is. It also works. (Note: yes you pack chlorella and toss it into the water in the morning)</p>
<p><strong>Paperwork: </strong>No one
should be using paper. Always put everything on an iPad. Period. The way you
prevent ever carrying worthless pieces of paper is asking if “soft copies” are
fine. This is going to tell you how old the person is (decision maker). So not
only are you decreasing the weight of the items you need to bring they are
handing you valuable information. No one under 40 or so wants to deal with
paper, it’s all digital. </p>
<p><strong>“Dead Clothing”: </strong>If
you know you’re going to have to pick items up and perhaps carry things? Guess
what just take some workout clothing/accessories that you’re going to get rid
of soon. Extreme yes… again that’s why it is called extreme organization. You
can one time use it and be on your way. You can take it to the ultimate extreme
by throwing away old workout shoes if you need to (this of course would mean
you’re picking something up on the very last day). </p>
<p><strong>Scatter Pack: </strong>Need
to carry a lot of cash? Scatter pack it. If you are moving more than $100,000
around, you want to stack it up into groups of either 5,000 or 10,000 and
scatter it around the carry on. This won’t be registered by the equipment and
you won’t have to waste time with TSA for example if you’re going through TSA
instead of Clear.</p>
<p><strong>Not So Extreme: </strong>Always
have the following: Clear, TSA Pre-Check, Global services. Also have the
following: travel sized liquid containers and combs/grooming kits that are thin
(less space). Also have your phone set to vibrate and stacked alarms to give
you an idea of when you need to get going. All of this is obvious but it’s fun
to see how many people break all of these rules and end up wasting time going
to buy something at Walgreens last second. </p>
<p>That’s our quick rant on extreme prioritization in a travel
heavy environment. Yes. This article was written on a phone hence the limited
time to organize a photo or backlinks. It has been insanely busy this year and
on a positive note we will have a Q&amp;A on a Monday (yes we’ve actually got a
Monday off). So circle that day and then we’ll do our status/class post on
Tuesday. As many of you have noticed the $150K a year online crowd has finally
turned negative on our blog, right in-line with our expectations. We finally
made the jump to the next level so the content here will naturally change. For
the better, the people at the top for some reason are always more attractive,

<p>I haven’t had a day off or been home since Christmas, I travel for bussiness all the time, work 12-40 hours a day and would say I dont get out anymore. </p>
<p>now I am far from where I want to be, but man the things you say are becoming true.. specially the starting to notice how mediocre the average person is [dont get me started on hiring people] not caring about dating [still getting with cute girls, which is hilarious cause I dont even try anymore] and appreciation of finer things, especially culinary experiences and style.</p>

<p>Pretty accurate post, as a guy that sacrificed the working out and relationships in times where you could bring in 7 figures, it can be tough but you make hay while the sun is shining.  There does come a point though where the next deal doesn’t move the needle.  Being a few years ahead of you guys in the age and money curve it will be interesting to hear how your opinions evolve on the dating front.  Being a guy on the wealthier end of the spectrum that is reasonably attractive and fit is a hell of a lot of fun in your 30’s and early 40’s…there is literally no shortage of attractive women, but it does get kind of old.  Of course you don’t want to settle down for the sake of settling, but life does actually get more fulfilling having the right partner, finding one is pretty freaking tough though.  Anyway, great blog, I think you guys offer some really accurate guidance to the up and comers out there.</p>

<p>If you don’t mind, I’m very curious to hear you elaborate on how your 30s / early 40s went and then the change after finding your partner.</p>
<p>Me: 30s, quite paper wealthy (so haven’t great disposable cash for most of the journey), starting to feel a bit of the change I believe you’re describing.</p>

<p>Well I’ll try and make this as short as possible.  I left a big company to be partners in tiny company at 27.  Worked ass off relentlessly for about 5 years.  Before I looked up and noticed I was a millionaire and earning mid six figures.  Of course relationships suffered because not a lot of girls that age grasp wanting to be wealthy so you don’t have to work so hard later in life, I had a few really nice girls that just didn’t work out for one reason or another, probably me being so dedicated.  Having a unlimited expense account and high income to boot, dating beautiful women in multiple cities around the world became normal. I then decided around 36 to find “the one” and settle down.  I picked extremely poorly, had two terrible relationships in a row.  All the while professionally I’m kicking ass.  Made about $1.8M my biggest year, north of $1 most years.  I didn’t follow the WSP instructions though as I had nice cars and boats, and a beautiful multimillion dollar home on the water to boot…luckily all paid for in cash and no debt or leverage at all, so my net worth could be a lot higher.  So after my last shitty relationship I went into full playboy mode and just had fun.  3 years later I sold my interest in the business and spent a couple years traveling the world and slowing down a bit.  Net worth ballooned past 8 figures and still climbing in retirement because even with a lot of stuff, living a great life is still pretty cheap.  </p>
<p>Then one day a unicorn walked up to me at the gym and my life has never been the same, we chatted and did a work out together, which turned into meeting at the gym 4 days a week I told my best friend that same day I met her that I met the woman I would marry.  This summer we are tying the knot and I couldn’t be happier.  It is true that when you meet the right person it really clicks.  We now travel the world together as she has a kick ass career that compliments me perfectly.  Sorry this isn’t so short, but just going from one beautiful woman to another gets old, having a true partner has brought me much more happiness than all the others added together.  For the record I had resigned myself to the bachelor life, I thank my lucky stars it worked out the way it did.  Good luck to you as well!</p>

<p>Well timed post.</p>
<p>Additional xtreme tips,</p>
<p>-Use Gmail’s ‘All Inboxes’ feature. </p>
<p>-Have a long e-mail or text response? Send a voice memo instead</p>
<p>-Avoid all processed and sugary foods/drinks. No healthy option? Water and coffee or green tea, skip the meal. </p>
<p>-Assume your next Hotel doesn’t have black out shades, have an eye mask that you can actually sleep with. </p>
<p>-Turn the hotel room temp to 68* F or below immediately upon getting in room, keep it there</p>
<p>-Have a pre sleep routine, find a sleep meditation on YouTube and do it. </p>
<p>-Melatonin should be used only if you need to sleep and aren’t tired. 2-3mg is plenty for me</p>
<p>-Turn on Nighttime mode prior to getting in bed </p>
<p>-Bose portable mini speaker. Utilize it, especially in the mornings. </p>
<p>-Cold showers. Yes, they help expedite the process of waking the f up</p>
<p>-Always assume Uber is going to take 15 min longer than what the app says</p>
<p>-If you slept like shit, replace your mid day low level work with a nap, you’ll likely be crashing around that time anyway. Get prepared for the important work coming later in the day. </p>
<p>-Also, to re iterate…water. Drink a lot of it. Ideally a higher end brand like Fiji, not Dasani</p>

<p>– Spot on:  ”It means that you just don’t have time for a full workout for 7 straight days. So you’re going to choose only four exercises: Cardio, back, chest, legs. Forget everything else.” Have been applying this successfully in last couple of years. It works.</p>
<p>– I am in the asset management biz: putting in an extra gear as lots of ‘new money’ to pitch with ‘smart’ money getting liquidity from stupid ‘retail’ money. –&gt; look at who is getting liquidity on the other side of IPO’s / leverage buyouts. Those are my target clients, so busy year to grow book.</p>
<p>Money making trades in 2019 so far:</p>
<p>– Rates, agriculturals, iron ore, crypto, fx (long USD), vix calls</p>
<p>At the end of the day it is much more fun to make money than to spend money. Simple truth.</p>

<p>Some further tips when on a crazy travel schedule:<br/>
– Dehydration: bring electrolyte tablets. You tend to not drink enough when traveling, and if in hot/humid temps are probably sweating a fair bit. Recharging your salts is essential.<br/>
– Paper: completely agree with your comment on paper. It just wears you down. If you think it’s “easier” to organize with paper, then you just need to work on your digital archiving system. A free wake-up call for many! Personally, I didn’t go for an iPad Pro, but I found myself a “13 ultrabook with touch screen (easier for reading docs if you can scroll). This is because if I want to do some quick math on a potential deal I prefer to use XLS.<br/>
– Travel wallet: I have a separate large purse/wallet that fits passport, cards, cash. The last thing you want to do while traveling is fiddle around with a separate cardholder, passport, etc.<br/>
– Headphones: noise-canceling. Clearly.</p>

<p>Great stuff guys. </p>
<p>Been doing more HIT for the busy days. Look up Mike Mentzer and Marcus Reinhardt – they did a video and Marcus was in Cernovich blog before. </p>
