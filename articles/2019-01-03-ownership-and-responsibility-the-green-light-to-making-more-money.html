<p>Around the age of 21-23 most people find out that the work place is not as easy as they thought. For those that end up starting a company they also find out that ownership is 100x harder than working for a Company. Either way, when you’re exhausted all of the time you begin to think in terms of time. <em>“I would rather find a position that pays the most for the least amount of hours”</em>. While great in concept (no one wants to work long hours for low pay), tying income to any sort of ticking time clock is not a good way to get rich. Imagine walking up to someone and saying they have to pay $1,000 per hour for your time (~$2 million a year). Everyone would laugh unless you were already a famous/wealthy person who could add that much value in an hour. Now if you said you expect to make $1,000/hour for every $3,000/hour you made them… the proposition would turn from laughter to <em>“Where do I sign up”</em>. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>What Not to Do – Tie Yourself to Hours</strong></p>
<p>Don’t work for an hourly wage or salary. This might not be possible
if you’re looking for anything to keep the lights on. That said, you want to
get out of an hourly/salary income since it will inhibit your income growth. This
is an attempt to leverage your time (which is limited to 24 hours regardless of
where you are in the world) and an hourly wage won’t give you an ability to
scale. </p>
<p>Take a look at high paying salaried/hourly professions and
it’s rare to see anything north of a few hundred dollars. Even $100 per hour is
$200,000 per year (rough math is to multiply the hourly wage by 2,000). Even if
you were able to generate this income and we assume a $200/hour position
($400,000/year) we have to remember that this is not something you can <em>sell</em>. For every hour you work you’re not
building any future income. If you decide you want to quit tomorrow, that
income stream is gone and no one pays you to leave your position (unless you
received a severance package). </p>
<p>Now that we’ve bashed this form of income, if you’re forced
to do something like this we would recommend anything where you’re sitting at a
desk. This allows you to at least “double dip” on your time. For example, the
chances that someone is reading this at work is quite high (we know this from
web traffic data). So if someone has time to sit around and watch Netflix or
Sports replays… They certainly have time to learn basic copy writing. For people
who are really desperate for money, you can also buy and re-sell products at a
premium (luxury hand bags, video game consoles etc.). The point here is that
having access to a computer and internet while at work is a huge advantage as
you can move the needle on your earnings without impacting your job
performance. </p>
<p>The main ideas here are as follows: 1) you cannot sell any
position that is deemed a job/career. Even if you were to start an amazing career,
when it comes time to leave you can’t sell it for money. 2) anything white collar
is significantly better than blue collar. There is absolutely nothing wrong
with high paying blue collar positions if that is where you must start. But. If
you can’t sit in front of a computer you have less access to future revenue
streams. 3) putting yourself in a position where you’re tied to time spent
versus results limits the amount of money you can make. Even if you were to
work 16 hour days, that’s going to be the official cap with no upside from
there. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>First Step in the Right Direction – Results Oriented Pay</strong></p>
<p>While we’ve touched on the importance of results oriented pay, it’s important to look at the math on why the numbers add up so quickly. There are really two types of payment mechanisms: 1) recurring and 2) high ticket priced items. We’re ignoring B2C (business to consumer) since the commission there is going mirror an hourly wage as there is a limited amount of revenue associated with each sale. While this concept is not new, we’ve finally figured out a way to explain it in terms of time. Essentially by tying yourself to units sold you’re able to condense the sales cycle. This is a common phrase used in a lot of businesses “sales cycle” all it really means is the time to obtain a sale. If you’re in a high ticket priced item business the sales cycle is typically long (investment banking is notorious for incredibly long sales cycles – classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/watch-the-company-man-give-away-his-life/">Company Man</a> lifestyle). In a new standard here we have a graph to depict the difference so it is visible. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4142" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545im_/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sales-vs.-Salary.png" srcset="https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sales-vs.-Salary.png 567w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sales-vs.-Salary-300x185.png 300w"/></figure>
<p>If you are earning say $200,000 per year and this is the
income you can generate without a results oriented position, you might be ahead
of the sales position in the near-term. This is because the sales person needs
to learn to *shorten* his sales cycle. By way of example if we assume the sales
person is a real estate agent and we give him a 2% commission (usually around 6%
combined seller + buyer so we’re conservative), he would need to sell about 5
houses worth $1,000,000 each. This is certainly an achievable number as you’re
looking at 1 sale every 2.4 months. In fact that number looks awfully low and
is likely tied to someone who is just getting started!</p>
<p>There are now multiple ways the sales person can catch up:
1) sell more homes at lower costs, say 20 homes at $500,000 to increase
inventory, 2) sell a single luxury home worth $5,000,000 or 3) <strong>*shorten his sales cycle*. </strong>The last one
is incredibly important. The last one is probably the most under-rated. Your average
person believes that you have to “screw people over” to get rich, when in
reality we can see that by shortening your sales cycle you’ll actually generate
a lot more money. If you do a fantastic job selling a property, it is quite
likely that the seller will then refer you to sell another property. As a rule
of thumb it takes about three years to significantly shorten your sales cycle
and it is certainly possible to sell two homes a month which would increase
your number of sales by almost 5 times. Since you were making $100,000 a year
with your low sales number, if you can increase your ability to sell that takes
you to nearly $500,000 a year. In addition, all you would need to do is increase
the average selling price slightly over the next 3 years and suddenly you’re
hovering around $600,000 a year. Not a bad position to be in.</p>
<p>The difference is quite large here, while the salaried
professional sees a steady increase to his income working to $300,000 over a 10
year span, the stair-step movement for the sales professional is quite
impressive. Instead of seeing a stable line up and to the right (not going to
work if you want to get rich), you see a big step function movement up. This causes
three significant changes for the sales person: 1) typically the sales person
has a lower cost of living since he doesn’t know if his transactions would
close, 2) the payments are one time in nature and up-front versus spread out across
a longer time period and 3) instead of having a question mark around his/her
return, he knows the exact amount that will be wired to his account on closing
day. </p>
<p>When we put this together you’re looking at a pretty huge spread between a salary employee and a solid sales person. The number we get to is around $3,000,000 in additional income over a 10 year time frame. This does not include any sort of “kicker” or benefit from selling higher priced items (higher margin) as is typical in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/enterprise-sales-a-legitimate-career-to-get-rich/">enterprise sales</a> outside of real estate. Also. We assumed that all of your sales are one-time in nature. If you’re lucky enough to land a position where you’re in charge of simply “renewing” contracts every year or two you’re in even *better* shape. This is because a high quality product has high retention and makes the follow up sale easier. </p>
<p>Now before we move to the value of equity it’s important to
understand the psychological reason why sales is avoided. The answer is quite
simple: responsibility. It’s not natural for humans to enjoy being told “no”
over and over again. So most people are unwilling to go through the process of
hearing negative feedback over and over until they figure it out. Also. It
causes the individual to see significant *responsibility*. Responsibility is
just a fancy way of saying “being forced to take care of yourself”. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Getting Rich with Ownership and Leverage</strong></p>
<p>If the sales person seemed attractive to you we have to
remember that he works for a Company. That company must make money otherwise they
wouldn’t hire the sales person. If the sales person makes $100,000 a year or
$5,000,000 a year… the company by definition needs to make more than this to
justify his employment. So while it’s exciting to see the numbers from a performance
based perspective, if we look at an ownership model we’ll see a bigger spread.
In fact the spread doubles (at minimum) if someone can earn the exact same
amount of money as the sales person.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4143" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545im_/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/equity.png" srcset="https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/equity.png 547w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/equity-300x194.png 300w"/></figure>
<p>Equity is everything. As you can see there is a substantial
difference between the sales person and the Company even though they earn
exactly the same amount of money. Even if the sales person is generating
$700,000 per year, he’s not worth as much as a company generating $700,000 per
year. Why? You can click sell. If you click sell we assume you’re going to make
around 5x (maybe the is aggressive. But. The point stands). Even if the sale
button was only 3x, you’re looking at a $2.1 million dollar difference in
value. Now it’s certainly difficult to build a $1 million dollar business, the
math says you’re better off earning an extra $50,000 from a business than an
extra ~$200,000 from any job. This is because of the “exit” multiple or equity
value. </p>
<p>Now lets turn to leverage and ownership. A common move once
you know a specific market well is to purchase businesses that can be turned
around. If you have a business that you bought for say $400,000 net income and
it generates $100,000 net income per year… You only need to increase the net
income by approximately $40,000 in two years to see a 100% return. Why? Well if
you generate $100,000 and then $140,000 you’re at $240,000… Then you have to
add $560,000 ($140,00*4) the new value of the Company and you’re at $800,000…
versus the original $400,000 paid out. There is certainly a discount here since
money next year isn’t worth as much as money today, however, the leverage is
clear as day. If you’re getting a 4x value for every dollar you bring in, this
means each dollar for your company is worth 4x as much as a dollar made working
for someone else. </p>
<p>But it gets even better. No one said you needed to use your
own money to purchase the asset. If you’re borrowing money you can actually see
even greater returns. This is exactly why real estate investors are commonly
self-made millionaires. Since you’re able to force appreciate the asset, you
can get well north of 100% returns in a short period of time by simply making
repairs or bargaining at the right time. So we can take a look at that quick
calculation as well. </p>
<p>If you purchase an asset for say 20% of the value (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190905055545/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/ten-rules-for-getting-started-in-real-estate/">using homes as that’s a common one to think of</a>) and it’s worth $100,000 that’s $20,000. Now once we make repairs/forced appreciation we can say the cost of that was $20,000. If the total investment is now $40,000 and the Home is now worth $180,000 and you sell… that is $80,000 in profit off of a $40,000 investment. While this may feel far-fetched, returns like these are actually <em>common when you have niche knowledge.</em> There are quite a few people who own homes, take out money from the equity of the home to purchase a business they know well and do exactly this. Before, these types of arrangements were most commonly tied to Real Estate and Real Estate only. We’re happy to say that is no longer the case (hint)! </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>In a time when there are few good investment choices (set it and forget it options) there is always an opportunity for forced appreciation. You’re not supposed to say “always”. But. We truly believe it. Markets are not perfectly efficient so if you look for the right property, business, or any asset that can be fixed, you can probably find it within the next month. This is essentially the plan we’re going with in 2019 since the rest of our money is going into more boring stable investments (around 3% returns). If you can fix it, the returns are likely higher <strong>and</strong> we would argue that it is less risky as well. So that’s our <em>“2019 Resolution”</em> a shift to forced appreciation purchases.<br/></p>

<p>Isn’t the idea behind a “forced appreciation purchase” the same as what private equity funds do? I believe those are the only type of funds which consistently beat the market.</p>

<p>Advantage of skilled blue-collar is the exit potential of contracting essentially turning it into sales. Demand is only increasing as successful business models and the general population is increasing. Automation may become an alternative but liability and human comfort interacting with AI will be future issues (average homeowners). There is network presence and license ability to drive RE repair/installation costs down. The scalability of turning 1 truck to 3 to 5+ is there. </p>
<p>I do agree it’s not more efficient than enterprise sales as the above model is more stress, hours, recurring costs, self-employment tax and forfeits the opportunity to earn $ online while at the workplace. It is capped somewhat compared to jumping into more profitable sales industries as an enterprise salesman as experience is gained.</p>

<p>Great post, indeed the multiple is the real game changer.</p>
<p>You earn 100K / year from a business and your net worth goes to 400K, you earn 100K / year from a job and your net worth doesn’t move.</p>
<p>This means that depending on the industry, with a business that makes 300K/year, you can become a millionaire.</p>
<p>Shortening the sales cycle or in general making more money after year 1 by fixing things is not easy, but certainly doable and more enjoyable than working a day job haha!</p>

<p>Regarding forced appreciation, I’ve heard of this business model:</p>
<p>Buy up a bunch of similar businesses within a certain distance of each other, rebrand them as the same(a chain), sell as a package at a higher multiple. </p>
<p>Anyone know of this working?</p>

<p>Great post as usual!  Recently left a job making over $700K, took about a 50% paycut, but gained about 20-40 hours a week to spend with family and grow my own business.</p>
<p>Currently working with a few friends on a local business purchase with metrics very similar to your Leverage &amp; Ownership paragraph.  5x multiple for this deal but about 1-2 turns in potential leverage which juices our return as you laid out.</p>
<p>As you guys know, I’m also a big real estate investor and my best deals are those where I can figure out where an owner is mismanaging the property (below market rents, better expenses like insurance costs, etc.) and fixing those problems quickly.  Although I’m not selling (buy and hold), I’m just reaping the benefit of higher cash flow and returns.</p>
<p>Also picked up on your *hint* on adding value outside of RE, which is another area I’ve been interested in but haven’t quite conquered just yet (a lot already going on as I laid out above) but know you guys have been talking about this for a while.</p>
<p>Happy New Year and more success to the WSPs in 2019!</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>So true about the starting and maintaining a bussiness and selling it for a multiple.. as an immigrant with $400 networth in 2012 [exchange rate is a bitch if you werent American] I worked my ass off and my way to making +100k/year, which I was super happy about, the golden standard right? then I read “money making machine” post when it came out, and it kept gnawing on me, started an affilate thing here, real estate license there and other sales related stuff and failed at all of them.. So I went back to working in my original field and being a tech nerd, however this time I was doing 12-18 hour days, 7 days a week for several months straight for 2 years, took every opportunity to work on new technology, new projects, new challenges.. became exceptional at what I do and known in my industry and making around 180k/year.. But kept lurking here, got both books and at last, I asked WSP for advice on my approach, and acted on it.. going out on my own [quit job] and partnered up with a company thats synergistic to my field.. 27k in revenue the first week.</p>
<p>Tldr, realize life has a deadline and use your time and energy [abundant in 20s] to become exceptional in a field, well known with good reputation, dont marry the job and start a company or get in an equity position ASAP.</p>
<p>And WSP, Thank you..</p>

<p>Recommend avoiding ‘white collar’ work with certain types of information (proprietary, classified, …) where you cant bring a personal phone/laptop into the office and/or lots of remote field site visits outside of cell data range. Disrupts ability to work on the side business</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Brilliant article as always. Another point I’d like to mention here is that business is the best way of creating generational wealth. You can be the highest paid person in any field but you can’t pass that position to anyone. Business, however. Also, as a third generation biz owner, I can say how much of a kick start I got joining my granddad and dad’s business. All their hard work, connections, and work is there. All the hard work I do will add on to that. Anyone starting a new business now will have to start from zero. To give you my own example, my grandad started a business with $30bucks(third world country) By the time dad came, we had two cars and a house. Now when I have joined the business revenue in excess $10million and very high-profit margin. Of course, it sucks that dad pays me only minimum wage and I don’t get a commission for the sales I make but I understand that and I also stand that by not taking out and splurging I am only strengthening my biz. Sure, I get jealous when my classmates earn exuberant slaries and drive high end cars in their jobs, but again, I am smart enough to realise that I don’t have to waste the effforts of my forefather rather let the compunding work</p>

It’s a female trait and most of the gossipers also have zero talent/skills and top out at $150K a year living horrible lives trying to explain that “their way is the best”
