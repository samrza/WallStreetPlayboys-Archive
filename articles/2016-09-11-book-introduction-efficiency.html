The same items came up over and over and over again: 1) money, 2) networking, 3) opportunities in the future and 4) how to maintain a healthy social life while doing all three. After large scale polling we’ve decided to create it with a completion date around <strong>July 2017 time frame.</strong> Here’s the introduction and how we think people should re-evaluate the rules they have been told to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Almost everyone who picks up this product is going to jump directly to the making money section of the book. Unfortunately? That will practically guarantee they will never “make it”.</p>
<p>Below is a list of 10 basic axioms to follow if you’re serious about success.</p>
<p><strong>1) Obligations Are Now Gone: </strong>If you are starting at ground zero, you have absolutely no obligation to anyone. This includes your best friends, your teachers and even your family if they are not going to help you succeed. Everyone encourages you to join the Peace Corps or worry about “the children” and other social matters that are now irrelevant to you. We will reiterate. All obligations for you to do <strong><em><u>anything</u></em></strong> are now gone.</p>
<p>It is important to note, this <strong><em><u>does not</u></em> </strong>mean you will live a life without consequence, it means that you will no longer have an excuse of “obligation to someone else”. This means every action you make is going to directly impede or help your future success and the only person you get to blame is yourself.</p>
<p>To wrap up on the obligation piece, this is not “cold hearted”. It is much more cold hearted to donate your time and help 20 people when you could have donated several hundred thousand dollars (or even millions!) that will <strong><em><u>help thousands of people instead.</u></em> </strong>If Warren Buffett never became the investor he is today, billions of dollars would go to waste. By signing a giving pledge, he will do more for society by himself than thousands of workers combined. In addition, he can pay for thousands of people to pursue their own dream of working for charities. Just remember, without his donations they wouldn’t be able to work in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>2) No More Third Party Pump Up Sessions: </strong>If you waste your time watching emotional videos about <em>“going out there and taking the bull by the horns”</em> we have no doubt nothing will be accomplished. These types of seminars, websites, videos, speeches etc. are all used to create a cult following. If you get 1,000+ cult followers who “feel good” from the event and one of them converts (law of large numbers) then more and more people will join the cult. It is an <strong><em><u>emotional Ponzi scheme</u></em></strong>.</p>
<p>Self-doubt is normal and it is something you will have to learn to deal with. If something “pumps you up” then you’re being sold something on the back end. Stop consuming it. Reading about the struggles of someone else will not benefit you, if you need to read stories like this it means you’re not taking your own life seriously.</p>
<p>When an outrageous success story can actually impact your life emotionally it means the creator of the content is <strong><em><u>converting your nervousness into positive energy.</u> </em></strong>The “sale” is simply converting deep seeded insecurity into positive pump up energy to make you buy some product that won’t actually get you anywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, to wrap up this point, when you’re getting into higher risk situations the only thing that will help you perform better is preparation.</p>
<p>Public speaking is the best example. If you are nervous before the event, practice live demonstrations in front of other people <strong><em><u>thousands of times</u></em></strong> until you can barely speak. You’ll find that you’re no longer nervous because you’re prepared and don’t need some army ranger yelling at you to get “hyped”. The more you practice the more you are desensitized to the potential negative emotions.</p>
<p>99% of people fall victim to the motivation Ponzi scheme because they are never internally motivated. <strong>It means less competition for YOU</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3) No Social Media, No Television: </strong>Unless you’re using social media to make money, go ahead and shut it down. Joe and Sally from college, high school or your childhood do not matter anymore. It is not harsh. If you’re not where you want to be, why would you waste time following the actions of people that won’t help you get to your goal?</p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Most people are hardwired to care about what their friends are up to. They even waste time following celebrities who make all their money because… people want to see what they are up to. By following the life of someone unrelated to you and someone who will never help you down the line, you’re wasting valuable time that you should spend on yourself.</p>
<p>To simplify this even more, social media should <strong>*not*</strong> be used to keep tabs on other people. It should be used to build up a brand and sell a product. Otherwise it was a colossal waste of time that would be better spent working for minimum wage.</p>
<p>For television, the point is quite simple. Every single hour spent on television is lost income while you <strong>watch someone else do their job/career</strong>. It makes no sense at all. If you run the math it becomes even sadder.</p>
<p>Average income in the USA is $50K, about $25/hour. The average person spends about 3 hours a *day* watching television. That is 21 hours a week.</p>
<p>Therefore? If this time was simply spent making money, it would lead to $27K in savings per year or a million dollars over ~36 years. The point? By simply working instead of watching TV you are practically guaranteed to be a millionaire even with no investment gains.</p>
<p>Before this section comes off as isolationist, lets clear up a point. Every single person bringing you up to your goals or helping you get there will remain in your phone forever. However. If they switch to becoming time sucks where they complain about life or drag you down in any way, they no longer deserve your time.</p>
<p><strong>4) Find One Committed “Friend”: </strong>You don’t need more than one. Find a single person who wants to succeed as badly as you do and make sure you keep in contact for at maximum one time per month. That is only twelve times a year (you’re going to be too busy doing work).</p>
<p>If you can find a single person willing to give 80+ hours of effort per week to becoming successful, the chances that you both make it will be magnified. You’ll likely hit different hurdles and a one hour conversation once a month will help jump over those issues each time.</p>
<p>Importantly, you should choose different industries, this makes it impossible to compete down the line. In the long-run? Your questions will cease as the issues become too specific (a good thing).</p>
<p><strong>5) Health Will Take a *Temporary* Hit: </strong>This will sound contradictory to the original statement that health is more important that wealth. That statement is still true.</p>
<p>The point of this bullet is that you have to find your own personal limits to work. Most people make the excuse of “needing” multiple things from specific sleep schedules to leisure time. If you’re young, you get the <strong><em><u>privilege of testing how far your body can go</u></em></strong> and once you actually break down (once) you’ll know exactly where the line is.</p>
<p>You’ll find that your body sends off specific queues when you’ve officially reached your limit and once you can recognize them, you’ll unlikely impact your health going forward. As a simple example, most will feel discombobulated when reaching their limits. They will misplace items, become disorganized immediately and make mistakes even with simple tasks such as pouring a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>To reiterate the emphasis around <strong><em><u>temporary health impact</u></em></strong>, once you know your body’s limits you won’t “push through” as it does not end in productive work and is a clear hit to your personal health.</p>
<p><strong>6) Find Your Talents: </strong>Most people are talented in several different areas. The difficulty is finding out if you’ll be in the top 1-5% in the segment. Without breaking into the top 5% in your field it will be quite difficult to earn a large amount of money as income is not a standard curve (winner gets a much larger share of the spoils).</p>
<p>We’re keeping this bullet basic by summarizing talents in a single sentence: <strong><em><u>you have to be good enough to have *other* people tell you that you’re good</u></em></strong>. If you have enough potential, this will happen on its own. It does not matter if you’re interested in the item at all, if you want to succeed, <strong><em><u>becoming the best is much more important than simply doing a task that is “fun” for you</u></em></strong>.</p>
<p>To reiterate, as you try out different fields, you’ll only keep a list of items where *other people* tell you that you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>7) Learn Sales for Every Interaction: </strong>Even if you decide the path to making money off a business is not for you, the skills you learn by selling will give you the <strong><em><u>toolbox necessary to live a comfortable life</u></em></strong>. While there is a negative stigma around sales, it is far and away the best skill to learn if you were to choose only one. Forget about complex mathematics, forget about hard science, if you can sell, you can transfer that skill into the most important aspects of your life: earning money online, dating, making friends and interviewing.</p>
<p>In short, sales is the <strong>*most*</strong> transferrable skill you will ever learn. Every single second you spend improving your salesmanship will give you a 100x return.</p>
<p><strong>8) Focus on Scale: </strong>You will likely need to trade time for money at a <em><u>very early age in life</u></em> (covered later in this book). However. All of your free time will be spent on a scalable business. A scalable business that is worth your time has two attributes: 1) recurring income and 2) a large addressable market.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, while you’re learning a specific industry near-term you should find a niche market where you can be the <strong><em><u>expert</u></em></strong>. This will then open doors to other markets assuming you have chosen correctly.</p>
<p>As a basic example, if you begin designing clothing you can then move into jewelry/accessories as they are somewhat similar. If you’re good at both you could move into makeup and other ancillary markets to retail. Simplistically, every niche market falls into a major market and as you succeed in one niche, begin opening up peripheral vision to other sectors you can learn about and understand well. (Note: this may require a completely different brand)</p>
<p>As a basic terrible example? You’re looking at it. A book is a horrendous way to get rich because each sale is one time in nature. If one person reads your book they will not buy another copy for no reason. In addition, even if they buy a book for a friend… That friend does not need two books either. Eventually you saturate your market and there is no recurring income left! Books are not good ways to make money because they are <strong><em><u>NOT RECURRING REVENUE.</u></em> </strong></p>
<p>Since our readers are smarter than average… Now you 100% understand why magazines were sold on subscription basis. You had to renew every 12 months to create another sale for the company. Without new content the business model would die.</p>
<p><strong>9) Stress is Okay, Worry from Real Problems is Not: </strong>The extreme Entrepreneurs and future billionaires will likely tell you to simply drop everything you’re doing and go “all in”. We take a bit of a different approach given everyone has different risk tolerance levels. We’ve found that worrying about paying your bills on time and struggling to get by usually results in too much stress that prevents your “creative juices” from flowing.</p>
<p>This is why we recommend a bar-bell approach that will be detailed later in this book. Where you build enough income to not worry on a daily basis (usually 10-20% above cost of living) then shift the remainder of your time to scaling a business and creating recurring income.</p>
<p>We have nothing against risk loving individuals and if you’re unphased by being evicted and going through turmoil to become exceptionally wealthy we wish you the best of luck on your journey.</p>
<p>Our simple line is you should feel immense stress, but not enough to cause you to worry. Real problems cause people to worry which then impedes results over the long-term.</p>
<p><strong>10) No Time to Live Above Your Means: </strong>This is why frugality is not a good strategy to get rich. The only difference between the recommendations of frugality and the recommendations here is this: frugal people spend time <strong>*cutting cost*</strong>, future multi-millionaires spend time <strong>*creating income*.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re serious about moving up, you’re not going to have time to spend thousands of dollars on fancy clothing, cars and bottle service (for now). When you’ve got enough money to never work again, you can spend as much as you like.</p>
<p>While clear bullet points are easy to remember the foundation, is simply this: <strong><em><u>we all have no one to blame but ourselves.</u></em></strong> This is why we emphasize the importance of no excuses. If someone “else” is dragging you down, you should have no qualms in deleting that person from your life forever. There is no reason to keep them even if <em>“society tells you that you should”</em>. You only get one chance at life and you deserve to pursue each activity… baggage free.</p>
<p>With the important introduction out of the way, below is a flow chart of the design and purpose of the book.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll note that the name of the book is called <strong>“Efficiency”</strong> for a reason. There will be a lot of extreme ideas placed here to save time. Many will call them crazy. We call them helpful. We have to make the most out of every single day. Why the obsession with efficiency? We don’t have much time to succeed in life and the quality of life continues to decline once we hit middle age. There is no point in wasting our most precious resource: <strong>Time.</strong></p>
<p>—-</p>
<p><strong>Addendum: </strong>In summary, there is absolutely no competition for making it into the top 1%. If someone wants to be in the 1% all they have to do is follow the items above and it’s practically impossible to avoid becoming a millionaire and making mid 6 figures. The reality is competition really begins at the 1% level because you fight two major headaches: 1) psychologically difficult to work as you don’t need the money and 2) anyone still grinding it out when they do not have to is extremely difficult to beat. There is a “knee in the curve” and competition goes parabolic.</p>

<p>How do you guys approach ethical considerations for sales? </p>
<p>For instance – selling a emotional pump and dump like the motivational speaker market. If this was your skill, would you even apply a ethical consideration? Would you justify it or just leave the ethical considerations for the poor?</p>

<p>If you were that worried about ethics why would you be selling a product like that?</p>
<p>Additionally, why would you be selling it if you didn’t believe in the product in the first place?</p>
<p>People who sell those books/seminars really believe that they work. They really believe that the motivation that they give people is the difference between them doing nothing, and pursuing their dreams.</p>
<p>And for some cases that’s true. They sell a service like anybody else. They tell people to get goals and get their lives moving where they want them to go. It’s up to the buyer to actually apply it.</p>
<p>The reason motivation shit is BS isn’t because it doesn’t work. It’s because the majority of people who buy it, won’t turn that motivation into action. And most people who are self-motivated and already taking action, don’t need Tony Robbins to get them going in the morning.</p>

<p>Good post. </p>
<p>One irony is that I found this post through social media (you linked it on Facebook). </p>
<p>Additionally your point about health is a little bit wrong. People are not necessarily intuitive enough to to be fully aware of the long-term detriments of sleep deprivation. A better recommendation would be 8 hours sleep and 1 hour daily meditation. This would make the person receiving the advice guaranteed long-term healthy, and the other hours in that person’s day could be fully utilized and focused on their goals.</p>

<p>Your first point about the irony linking this through Facebook – irrelevant. Should be “used to build a brand or sell a product”. This article fits that bill.</p>
<p>I believe the 8hr rule has been shattered long ago. New studies (plural) show 7.25hrs roughly to be optimal for health. At 8hrs sleep per night you’ll be successful already. Even working a regular full time job I’d be surprised if a person could hit 8hrs with 3hrs tv time a night.<br/>
In m  experience, 6-7 would be best for maximising work efficiency.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the book, outstanding post as per usual WSP.</p>
<p>Disagree with your comments regarding books as a horrible way to get rich though. A lot of $ can be made through producing a series of books that lead on from one another. When enough books have been written and self-published, you can then establish various product funnels.</p>

<p>I think they mean in terms starting from ground zero sort of thing. As in if you are a no one who did nothing and made nothing, spending time writing books to sell isn’t a good time investment because no one knows you to buy. </p>
<p>It seems like in your example, you are already some authority who have book(s) and products and a web presence going on where you can redirect people down different funnels and mailing lists.</p>

<p>Yes please make the book.  I’ve been a long time reader and while I have a long ways to go, I’ve made tremendous strides following the actionable advice from these articles.</p>
<p>Biggest takeaway: I used to think the most important thing was health.  But I realized it’s *Time* and it’s not even close.  I was glad to see you reiterate this at the end of the article.  I’m 28 and made tons of mistakes, but I’m doing my best to leverage time to turn things around.  </p>
<p>One of the biggest time savers for me was outsourcing a healthy diet.  I live in NYC and there are many meal prep options to choose from, but my roommate and I simply put out a listing on craigslist stating we wanted someone to cook healthy meals for us following our calorie/macro plan.  The number of people who already do this in NYC is astronomical.  I couldn’t believe how many responses we got.  We had to interview a few people and chose a struggling actor who didn’t mind making an extra $800 a month.  This guy went grocery shopping for us, came to our apartment, cooked all our meals, put them in containers, and entered the info on myfitnesspal.  The amount of time it saved is priceless.  </p>
<p>I see my coworkers pay $40+ for a single boutique fitness class yet struggle to make any changes to their health/appearance (while eating $15 dollar greasy lunches and snacking all day). As usual, doing the opposite has worked wonders.  Instead, I spend extra on healthy organic food and a personal chef and pay about $12 a month to go to a NYC public gym.  Pro Tip: I’ve received some of my best lifting advice and form critiques from strong guys that don’t have a pot to piss in.  </p>
<p>This weekend walking around the streets of Manhattan I saw grown men piss drunk while wearing their college team’s jersey in the middle of the day all over.  Today, the first NFL weekend will be more of the same.  I’m looking forward to finishing the Zig Zaglar book.</p>

<p>Sorry for the double comment here but: </p>
<p>“This weekend walking around the streets of Manhattan I saw grown men piss drunk while wearing their college team’s jersey in the middle of the day all over. Today, the first NFL weekend will be more of the same. I’m looking forward to finishing the Zig Zaglar book.”</p>
<p>I love football season. Great time to leave everyone in the dust for next Spring.</p>

<p>We pay him $400 each but that does not include groceries.  He buys groceries and we reimburse him for that too.  He goes to Trader Joes and buys lentils, brown rice, fresh fruit, meal in bulk so it’s pretty cheap.  This is just what we negotiated with him, and he had other people interested too.  He offered to log all our macros on myfitnesspal we didn’t even ask him to.  He used to be obese but realize he needed to get his act together if he wanted to succeed as an actor in NYC.  Definitely more expensive then cooking yourself but I found the time I save to be well worth it.</p>

<p>WSPs, the mentor that every 20 something with a hunger for success would be more than grateful to have! Thank you for creating this site, don’t you dare stop posting! I seriously mean that!</p>
<p>I’ve been a long time reader of WSP and loved the advice the site gives to a lot of men in regards to career choice and finances. The posts are real, get right to the point, and give a lot of younger guys the much needed direction they need in a society where our minds are flooded with large amounts of bad advice. I particularly enjoy how WSP is big on using numbers and age range to describe life goals and where a person should be in life, makes reading the site a whole lot easier and things much clearer to me personally. </p>
<p>IMO, WSP is one of the best sites on the web but I do wish that the writers could spend some time in the future doing a piece on social life that makes things clearer as well, especially as you get older and hit your 30s, because I fear that society might be flooding our minds with horrible advice about social life as well. Google “social life after college” and see the countless depressing articles come up on ThoughtCatalog, Buzzfeed, and Elite Daily. Ask the “average person” (who we can all agree sucks!) about it and they will tell you that you aren’t even supposed to have one after your mid 20s because you’re supposed to get married, have kids, get fat, and whine about how much life sucks to other “adults” while wishing your were back in college. The average person whines about social life as you get older and keeps complaining but we’ve been trained to think and do the opposite, I want to hear about it from the winners like you guys.</p>
<p>A while back WSP wrote a legendary post on why it is normal to be unhappy in your 20s and a large part of it had to do with feeling isolated and feeling like you’re missing out on something. Missing out on the spring breaks, formals with hot girls, date nights, hookups at house parties, and partying with a group of people around your age who you became friends with; all of that has to take a toll on a guy. Being in a situation like college, working hard to build a career, but then wondering if you’re missing out because the social opportunities like those in college might (and I hope that is a might and not a will) not surround you in life once again.</p>
<p>I know for me, it led to a great deal of unhappiness in my college years but what kept me going is this belief that maybe once I do make it in a few years, there is something even better to look forward to and work for in regards to social life. Now as I grow into my 20s and get older, my career slowly starting to come together, and figure out my way; it is a worry that is always in the back of my mind. A worry about whether or not the social opportunities for parties, amazing social events, friends, and fun experiences will exist when I finally do get there. I mean the material possessions, freedom, and money to do whatever would be nice but it would be amazing to enjoy it with other successful people in a similar situation… An active social life has really been something that I want in my future but I worry if I have unrealistic expectations of it.</p>
<p>The posts about being in your 30s hinted at it but I could never really put the pieces together too much, walked away thinking that it is supposed to be lonely for the most part but you do better with women.</p>
<p>TLDR; Lost and confused commenter would like if WSP addressed the social life aspect a bit more due to the large amounts of bad advice about it from “average people” (who we can all agree suck). Wants to know what an idea social life should look like as you get older according to WSP because he is tired of the whining from “average people” and horror stories from a lot of mainstream blogs.</p>
<p>PS: </p>
<p>Don’t sleep on the importance of social media, seems like social life might be heading in that direction in the future. At my university, a lot of the popular kids (who are doing quite well in life now, a few of them ended up on Wall Street and working lucrative careers) all had a distinct and large social media presence. I mean in a way, it is a form of status and sales, you’re convincing to the world that by having a large social media following/”friends”, you’re not a social outcast. I feel like with my generation, not being on social media means something is wrong with you and many employers even use it against you if you aren’t on LinkedIn.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>I have been a long time followers, and maybe thats why the below is “coincidental”.. but.. Post is coming at an interesting time for me. </p>
<p>“This is why we recommend a bar-bell approach that will be detailed later in this book. Where you build enough income to not worry on a daily basis (usually 10-20% above cost of living) then shift the remainder of your time to scaling a business and creating recurring income.” </p>
<p>I have the income part down (unfortunately its working for someone else 8-9 hours a day, but eliminates “worry”) and have failed several times in business and am finally making headway on a real idea(I think). Spending any second of downtime between the two learning even more internet sales. </p>
<p>I have finally realized that unless I put almost every hour into the latter part of that quote (building biz), I will likely never get there as the momentum/experience will not be built, and the time simply won’t be spent. That brings me to the point I’m literally realizing and now practicing: </p>
<p>“There is no reason to keep them even if “society tells you that you should”. You only get one chance at life and you deserve to pursue each activity… baggage free.”</p>
<p>Many of my “friends” and “family” don’t understand them when I try and tell them why I’m not going to happy hour or out to meet them for “drinks” any more. When I say (in so many words) its not going to contribute to my goal(s) or have a SIGNIFICANT change of me meeting great people/getting laid, they scoff and think I’m a dick (I don’t care, tells me I’m doing the right thing). </p>
<p>Weaknesses for me now are anxiety built from rushing to try and get to my goal, as well as uncertainty with business ideas and plans that have even been semi-validated by long time entrepeneurs. Not to mention, I can always learn more about biz, internet biz specifically. </p>
<p>LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REST OF THIS</p>
<p>PS. Questions would be – although the main goal is money when young, I do have side goals that are spent when there is absolutely nothing else productive i could be doing on the main goal – thoughts?</p>

<p>would pay top $ for a detailed book </p>
<p>Knowing you guys, I’m sure it would be top shelf quality compared to the majority of books on the market today </p>
<p>if you are looking for specific requests I would love an in depth section on skill building and finding talents. Also a section on money psychology. Aware that these posts exist already but more information on them wouldn’t go unappreciated. </p>
