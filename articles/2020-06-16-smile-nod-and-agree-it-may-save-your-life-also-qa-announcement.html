<p>For the next 18 months we’d strongly recommend that you begin mastering the art of “smiling, nodding and agreeing”. At this point, many people have seen their net worth drop by 10-30%. While most just focus on the stock market, the cash flows for a lot of individuals went negative or to zero. Imagine paying $10K a month in rent for a local Bar owner, and suddenly you have to pay the rent while getting $0 in revenue for 2-4 months. That’s a massive negative margin hit and has to be funded by cash you have on hand. You have to pay employees or fire them, pay the rent and utilities and pay your own bills while getting $0. This is a massive massive hit to any cash you have. The only solution here is to “smile, nod and agree” a lot more particularly if you’re benefitting from the downturn. </p>
<p><strong>Smile, Nod and Agree Basics: </strong>If you want to get far in life without burning a lot of time, you’re going to <em>“smile, nod and agree”</em>. Most are familiar with this concept (if they have followed us for a few years), but for the newer readers it means that you’re not going to voice any opinion. You simply smile at the person, nod and agree with the point they are making. </p>
<p>Why would you do this? It saves you a lot of time. So when people bring up the main time wasters: politics, gossip about someone else and sex/religion you just agree. If you don’t agree… you agree anyway. You’ve saved yourself from a long argument where no one will change their mind. No one gets into an argument about any major topic like that with the following conclusion: <em>“Great discussion you’ve really changed my mind”</em>. Does not occur despite what people will tell you. They just go back and stew on the topic and solidify their current view.</p>
<p>You’d think that this is an easy skill to master. It isn’t. It’s a life long skill like sales. Even if you think you’ve got it down pat, there are some people that will prod and prod and prod trying to get info out of you. Do your best. You can usually avoid these types of conflicts for 5-6 hours or so (usually enough to avoid any debates). No need to take down their phone numbers and you’re set. </p>
<p><strong>Economic Impact of 2020: </strong>With the main premise out of the way, it’s time to apply this to finances. No matter what, you should no longer disclose how much you’re making and you should *no longer guess* how well the other person is doing. This is a huge change from what we’ve said in the past. </p>
<p>In normal economic times, you are free to “lie down” and say you make about 80% of whatever the other person makes. It is fine to do this in normal economies because the chances of being wrong is quite low. When employment is high, you get an idea of what the person does, you can easily just lie to the downside. This creates no animosity and they feel like you’re still in their “economic class”.</p>
<p>This is out the window in 2020. You will now run into people who are actually up this year and you’ll run into people who are at zero, went negative or worse. Better to avoid the topic all together at this point. When people try to prod just make blanket statements such as “This COVID thing really negatively impacted my life”. Don’t need to say anything else beyond that. They will fill in the blanks by themselves and you won’t have to get into an uncomfortable conversation about making money. In fact, they will avoid that topic out of “courtesy”. </p>
<p><strong>Personal Impact of 2020: </strong>The second one we’re seeing is significant personal life changes. You do not want to ask questions about where a person is living, where they were living before etc. This is a standard topic of conversation when you meet new people at a particular social setting. Where you’re from what you’re doing now etc. </p>
<p>Why do you want to avoid this? Their personal lives may be uprooted entirely and you might hit a bad nerve. It’s a big one to be aware of (very big). If someone gets laid off and decides to move abroad for a bit… when they come back it’s unlikely the same. Life just doesn’t work that way. Some people may have to go back home as their family members are getting crushed by the pandemic. The list of potential issues is long. </p>
<p>As a point of emphasis, this only applies to new people. No need to be a psychopath with no emotions for your friends/family. We’re referring to new people you meet for the next 18 months. As you know, first impressions are incredibly impactful so you don’t want to leave a negative feeling behind. The same rule of life applies:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>People do not remember what you said they only remember the way you made them feel</em>. </span></p>
<p>This is common knowledge yet it is frequently forgotten. If you think you might be steering the conversation in the wrong direction, always choose the smile, nod and agree approach… and cap it off with something positive for extra safety. You do not want to trip an emotional trigger in the current economic environment. </p>
<p><strong>Socioeconomic Impact: </strong>This one is going to get very very ugly. We usually don’t type in that fashion “very very” and other wasted words/content. That said… it is going to get very, very, very, very ugly. This is because the haves and have nots have split quite dramatically over the last 3-4 months. Anyone who was able to maintain their income was able to get ahead, anyone who lost their income fell back dramatically (can’t even interview to replace their old jobs/careers) and anyone who made more money just put a year long gap between them and their peers.</p>
<p>The math is simple. If you usually make $10K in a month and spend $5K (again keeping it easy), then you’re saving $5K. Now if person A runs a small business that goes negative, his cash flows are -$20K for four months. Person B who somehow made more money, say $14K… Also saw spending go down (due to closures) and has saved $10K per month for four months. So one person is + $40K while the other is minus $20K creating a $60K spread… which is equal to $5K multiplied by 12 (<strong><em>a full year</em></strong>)</p>
<p>There is no easy solution here. We’ve talked about a few: 1) variable consumption tax – tax rates on a Honda Civic should be way lower than a Ferrari, while taxes paid on a $250K home should be way less than a $10M mega mansion, 2) instead of using UBI – blank checks – we should have universal basic food and water to prevent the funneling of money into nefarious activities and 3) a change in executive incentives to avoid share price focus and instead drill down on head count growth, revenue growth and stable profits. This would cause spending to go from buybacks to R&amp;D which creates jobs and also forces the Company to create value additive products at a faster rate. </p>
<p>While we love solutions, we stated up front that it’s not going to end well. There is no way we can suddenly change from the current structure to UBI, luxury taxes (not wealth taxes) and a complete overhaul of executive compensation. So the road to a better future is going to be long and arduous, we’d wager that it won’t be solved for at least 3-5 years. We’re praying some good solutions do come up… if a socialist takes the helm over the next 5 years or so we’re really out of luck as a Country. </p>
<p>Back to the point. You’re going to see an even steeper divide in the haves and have nots. CEOs have learned that a lot of their employees really weren’t adding anything and a lot of their employees were doing 2x their normal workload. This is the light bulb moment where income for the performers can go up and the non-performers can be removed… permanently. Since high-performers stay on the job, the remaining positions that open up (later) are going to be lower wage positions (need to prove value). So if you’re liked politically at your Company and you have a good paying position, don’t rock the boat. Keep collecting and working on your dreams at night since you’re working from home anyway (no commuting excuses anymore!). </p>
<p><strong>General Social Unrest: </strong>This is obvious from the past month or so. Lots of social unrest. It has reached a point where people believe that “silence is violence”… Which means “you’re with us or against us”. When massive issues like this occur there are usually three options: 1) agree, 2) say nothing and 3) disagree. The people promoting the phrase “silence is violence” are saying that you only have one option: agree or disagree… with their opinion. </p>
<p>Now you see why you must smile and nod. If you find out someone is aggressively on one side or the other you *must* smile and nod. If you do not smile and nod, you’re going to get into an argument even if you have no opinion on the particular social issue. Play it safe.</p>
<p>More and more issues will arise over the next 2-3 years as industries transform rapidly. Some because they have to and others because they are forced to. Imagine having no online presence (any company) over the past 3-4 months. You’d see zero revenue and have high fixed costs. An absolute nightmare. In addition, imagine not having an emergency fund for 3-6 months. You’d end up in credit card debt due to the expenses incurred once savings are depleted. So on and so forth. As these companies evolve and change, the work functions shift to knowledge and production. The days of repetitive tasks are dying at a rapid rate. </p>
<p>As these issues ramp up, remember to smile and nod in all new environments. Take the time to come to your own conclusions and contribute in a way that you see as productive. Don’t let the masses decide for you. Simply agree with whoever you are talking to and contribute in a way you see fit. No reason to tell them what you are doing. </p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A For Purchasers Only: </strong>We will hold our next Q&amp;A on Saturday June 20. This one will be shorter due to an extremely busy June. With things opening back up we expect to be back to normal on this blog by mid-July. </p>

<p>Great article and totally agree smile and nod works on both sides (proven and experimented in the last 2 months between COVID and civil unrest). </p>
<p>What are your thoughts on how this will unfold? I know this is not a Q&amp;A but I am very curious to have your opinion on this one. Do you think the crazy situation will likely die down (e.g. defund the police, silence)? It seems the vast majority of people are against it in the USA.</p>
<p>If you had to predict the future, what would be your guess? </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>One thing I have found works well in these times is exaggerate any flaws, trauma, or legitimate shortcomings from your past especially if your job requires you to be on LinkedIn and carry a title/represent your company. Post about how you were bullied growing up, always made fun of, and have issues going on in your life right now. People will love nothing more than to see others miserable because misery loves company. Tow the lines carefully though, don’t bitch about your job since you should be grateful to even have one right now.</p>
<p>Remote work has been a blessing around office drama though.</p>
<p>The other question I ask myself is if big cities in the US, NYC in particular, are even safe to live in anymore. For years the city enjoyed low crime rates and a great culture but SOHO recently got all looted. I live in the LES due to finding a good deal in the area and wanting to get the party animal out of my system on the occasional weekend (lol no bottle service or models and bottles though) but no way I am renewing my lease.</p>
<p>I thought the UWS or UES of the city since I do genuinely love it would be great but with the way the climate is these days, I wonder if streets of any major city are safe now. Perhaps the HAVEs are going to find refuge in a given part of the country or certain types of towns while escaping the big cities in general. I am just not sure what kinds of towns are going to have a lot of the 20-somethings who do have money to spend and want to spend the weekends enjoying a nice night out here and there. Such towns might also have local population not doing so well either so not sure where you go for a fulfilling life in your 20s if you are doing well.</p>
<p>Big cities seem to no longer be the answer but I will save this for the Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>This is what I have been thinking. There are no big cities to escape to because ALL of them are run like 3rd world countries. Even places like Omaha, NE &amp; Indianapolis are starting to look rough. </p>
<p>Minnesota is my home state and I remember in the 2000’s how safe it was. Minneapolis has changed so much for the worse. </p>
<p>If things continue to get out of hand I have heard nice things about Chile and Australia. Might be worth it.</p>

<p>I’m 25 and make 280k in NYC working &lt;20hrs/week, trust me the number of actually successful 20 somethings is just not very high in the city. </p>
<p>From what I've found, it was great to live in Manhattan pre-Covid because people want to go out in Manhattan but most people our age live in Brooklyn and Queens. If you're fully remote till 2021+ and you find your crowd living there, you may want to just upgrade to an incredibly nice studio/1BR in BK, Queens. You will have the highest quality place of anyone in that area and can spend more money on high end alcohol, party favors. I won't be doing this but only because I want to be in the Chelsea area.</p>

<p>I am from Orange County, CA and this is what I have been saying for years. </p>
<p>Only on the internet can you find a high concentration of teenagers who are self made. I still can remember opening up a business bank account when I was 20 and receiving all of those awkward stares that said, “what is this kid doing” . We are rare. </p>
<p>Almost every single early twenties guy who was self made who I have ever met either has some sort of social issue (I admittedly have severe OCD), is a complete nerd, or is physically unattractive. As someone who made his money with affiliate marketing and attends meetups/networking events, I still after 8 years have NEVER seen one of these teenager dropshipping gurus in real life.</p>

<p>Very wise words here. Seeing this a bit among my extended network (friends of friends) as the core peer group is either white collar or online biz oriented. I’ve benefitted during this time so the message is to be low key, try to listen more and speak less. </p>
<p>As you’ve said before, even without asking questions like job or where someone lives, one can get a read on people through other general questions and see how they respond. If they get, they get it. </p>

<p>Article could’ve not come at a more relevant time in my life. Being a new university grad, the vast majority of people I know are unemployed (and will likely remain that way for a while) or got fired a year into their careers due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Due to sheer luck, I somehow landed at an IB upon graduation and I know inherently not to bring this up to people as it will lead to resentment. Anyone I’ve ran into in the last month I’ve played the whole smile, nod and agree (just saying Corona killed me I have no job) which has saved many meaningless and potentially negative conversations. What’s crazy though is I revealed that I have a job in IB to 2 of my best friends (thinking they’d be happy for me) and… one said “omg how did YOU get a job like that, how can I get this job, can you get me a job???” (even though he’s super unqualified lol), the other had a flash of jealousy on his face and said “don’t bet on it lasting too long”. Losers.</p>
<p>Also the whole social unrest of “silence is violence” or “you’re with us or you’re against us” has actually been a huge eye-opener for me in a positive way. It made me realize undoubtedly that 99% of people operate solely on emotions which has been proven by the George Floyd protests/riots, the virtue signalers on social media (they don’t actually care, they just want to be a part of the herd) and with the Brendan Leipsic Instagram incident in May (not sure if you follow hockey but basically one of the most emotionally-based reactions I’ve ever seen in my life). This means it’s 10000% possible to make money online selling any product that targets emotion. Once I have my living expenses covered for a few months, I’m going all in on online sales no excuses. Keep well during these times Playboys.</p>

<p>Thanks for this great blog.  After many years of reading I finally took action and started an aff marketing biz.  After two weeks started making consistent daily profits and just need to scale.  </p>
<p>I told myself, “if you can’t earn money on online sales during this time, you NEVER EVER will.”  I didn’t want to see myself being a corporate drone the rest of my life and die thinking about what could have been.  I scared myself straight and have to say affiliate marketing has been the most exciting work I’ve ever done in my life.  I had multiple days where I could barely sleep because I was so excited to refresh my account to see how much money I made the day before.  Not a lot by any means yet, but the scalability of it should allow me to make consistent $100+ days in a couple months.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I deleted all but 7 friends from my facebook and several other social media accounts.  I’m not risking my livelihood on a late night status update.  I started journaling to keep my thoughts logged.  I imagine the ‘nomad capitalist’ model of making american money while living abroad will become very popular.  Inner cities will probably completely plummet now that middle classers realize they can work from home in rural areas that are safer and cheaper.</p>

<p>Good piece.</p>
<p>&gt;CEOs have learned that a lot of their employees really weren’t adding &gt;anything and a lot of their employees were doing 2x their normal &gt;workload.</p>
<p>I’ll add that as WFH becomes more common (many companies have decided to stay WFH instead of going back to offices to cut costs) you’d see a flattening out of the international disparity in compensation.</p>
<p>Someone in NY is not longer just competing with people in NY, he’s now competing with everyone in the world – in other words, cheap labor from abroad is now in fluid competition which will impact everyone’s incomes in first world countries.</p>
<p>Would be interesting to see how this will play out politically, but it will certainly increase the income gap between people in the first world.</p>
