<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>* * *</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>You should live your life like it starts at age 30.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why age 30? Because before age 30 is when your brain is at its most malleable and your body at its peak, in terms of energy levels and adapting to change.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This has to do with a bunch of physiological factors. Three big ones are that: (1) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190624143333/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"><span class="s3">homeostasis</span></a> grows in strength with age, weakening your body’s tolerance to stress, (2) dopamine levels go down in the brain, making it harder to do creative work for long bursts of time, and (3) testosterone levels decline, lowering ambition and energy levels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To make up for this natural decline, you want to maximize for the health of your brain and body after age 30.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This article is divided in two parts. The first part lays out helpful guidelines for how to live your life and manage your career up until age 30, while making use of the advantages of a youthful brain. The second part is about how to engineer your lifestyle for high mental engagement after age 30.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Part 1: Before Age 30 You Want to Maximize Your Chances of Becoming a Pioneer and Financially Independent</b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“A man’s character is formed before he is 30.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">–<b>Napoleon</b> </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The older you get, the harder it becomes to change. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><b>Carve Out Your Character: Be Who You Want to Be By 30, or Else. . .</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Napoleon said it. Lee Kuan Yew agreed. Neuroscience and biology indicate it, and I believe it.</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">The brain—including one’s personality, habits, and worldview—is most malleable before the age of somewhere around 25-35. So let’s call it age 30.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">The philosopher William James (who lived between 1842 and 1910) wrote much about the phenomenon that we now know to be <b><i>homeostasis</i></b>. At that time, science had little information about the brain, the endocrine system, and the formation of habits. Still, James wrote:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s5">“</span><span class="s1">The great thing, then, in all education, is to make our nervous system our ally instead of our enemy. It is to fund and capitalize our acquisitions, and live at ease upon the interest of the fund. For this we must make automatic and habitual, as early as possible, as many useful actions as we can, and guard against the growing into ways that are likely to be disadvantageous to us, as we should guard against the plague.</span><span class="s5">”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The big idea is to push yourself a little harder than what feels comfortable while you’re young and extra malleable. Then, when you’re older, it will become easier for you to go that extra mile and stay resilient to stress. </span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1"><b>Broadly speaking, you want to: </b>1) </span><span class="s1">Use your brain as much as you can, 2) </span><span class="s1">Delve into new areas of knowledge, and 3) </span><span class="s1">Deliberately incur stress on yourself and raise your pain-tolerance,</span></p>
<p class="p15"><span class="s1">Sounds easy, except most people don’t do it because it goes against </span><span class="s8"><b><i>homeostasis</i></b></span><span class="s1"> (which wants you to stay in your comfort zone and perpetuate the body’s current feedback loops).</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><b><i>Craft Your Career</i>: How to Maximize Your Youthful Brain and Become a Pioneer</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Historically, most new inventions or innovations have been made by young people, typically no older than 30 years old. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The science philosopher Thomas Kuhn said, “Almost always the men who achieve fundamental inventions of a new paradigm have been either very young or very new to the field whose paradigm they change.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is because young people are less cognitively blocked by outdated information from previous paradigms, and they have a higher degree of raw creativity. For example, consider these incredible achievements by young pioneers:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190624143333/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/table-of-innovators-and-pioneers.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3762" height="994" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20190624143333im_/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/table-of-innovators-and-pioneers.png" srcset="https://web.archive.org/web/20190624143333im_/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/table-of-innovators-and-pioneers.png 615w, https://web.archive.org/web/20190624143333im_/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/table-of-innovators-and-pioneers-186x300.png 186w" width="615"/></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As an interesting side note: We just interviewed Nicholas Sundén-Cullberg, the co-founder of Lendify (one of the fastest growing fintech companies in Sweden), for our podcast. Nicholas was 30 when he quit Morgan-Stanley and started Lendify. The goal is to create a new segment for the Swedish financial market through peer-to-peer lending and it’s going well for them so far.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Anyway: This doesn’t mean you’re screwed if you haven’t created your magnum opus by age 30, but you need to understand that <i>innovation</i> becomes more likely than invention as you grow older. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><b>Most “Post-30 Successes” Happen in Complex Fields</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s a strong historic trend that people who succeed big (and become very rich or make a ground-breaking discovery) after the age of 30, typically do so in a <i>complex</i> field. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In slower-moving (established) fields such as business, politics, or older branches of science, you usually need to learn a lot more before you can contribute something new. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Will this trend go on? Yes. And it will only grow in power, because the bar continues to be pushed up higher in almost all existing areas of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ever since the time of Isaac Newton (mid-17th century) the combined knowledge of science has roughly DOUBLED for every year. This means that every generation of scientists has had to solve more difficult problems than the last one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Newton’s time there was just <i>one </i>branch of science: Natural Philosophy. In 1995 there existed roughly 10,000 fields of specialty. No one knows the exact number today, but it’s a <i>LOT</i> more. If you’re a devious scientist, you can just make up your own title.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1905, Nobel-winning physicists (on average) made their breakthrough discoveries at the age of 37. In 1985, the corresponding age was 50. In chemistry, the age increased from 36 to 47 during the same period, and for medical scientists the age rose from 38 to 46. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>This leads us to two implications: </b>1) </span><span class="s1">It’s taking longer to become an innovator in the established fields of science because the basics—that you have to know just to keep up with others—are expanding and 2) </span><span class="s1">By simple reasoning of supply and demand, we can see that for as long as the trend of over-specialization and increased complexity </span><span class="s8">continues, there will be a premium on synthesis and the creative combining of existing ideas</span><span class="s1">. That is: <i>innovation </i>over invention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pop culture scientists don’t invent anything new, they just popularize existing knowledge. I bet you 9 out of 10 people know who Neil Tyson Degrasse or Michio Kaku is, but don’t know who John von Neumann is. I’m sure you can think of many similar examples from areas you are familiar with… </span><span class="s1">Now consider “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy” or “Cross-fit”. Nothing new there for anyone who knows even the basics about psychology and fitness. Yet, both are remarkably successful franchise concepts. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><b>Career Conclusions: Enter a New Area or Go With the 2X Rule</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You should put yourself in a position where you have incentive to learn as much as possible. For example, by becoming a free agent, an entrepreneur, or by working for a small company where people let you execute on your ideas freely and you’re given a lot of responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your interests are not related to business you should get involved in some (scientific) field where you have the opportunity to pursue your curiosity unhinged by bureaucracy, ideology, obsolete tradition, regulations, and other things that put your brain on a leash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However—statistically speaking—the chances of you entering a new industry are low, because the school system is set up in such a way as to train you for the old established industries, where it’s harder to make an impact. School does not help you become an inventor or an innovator. Or an entrepreneur for that matter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Assuming you’re under 30 and entering an established industry, <i>you should follow the </i><b><i>2X Rule. </i></b>This means your wage would have to be up to TWICE as high in order to justify working in an old industry or for a large hierarchical organization.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s assume you don’t care about becoming a pioneer, an inventor, or an innovator; all you want is to make a lot of money and live the good life. Well, you should <i>still</i> go with the<i> </i><b><i>2x Rule.</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why? Because most of the money being made right now (and in the foreseeable future) is in fields with new and fast-growing niches. These have a common denominator: most are in the intersection of science, finance, marketing, and online. To stereotype, let’s call it “Online X”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thing about “Online X” is that it’s a complex field; you need to understand how multiple pieces of the puzzle come together. This means you need either a strong talent for synthesis or (most likely) a couple of years’ experience before you stand a chance of making the big money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, the conclusion is pretty much the same: Try to get a head start and be willing to pay a premium for a steeper learning curve.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Now, let’s look at what NOT to do.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><b>Top 3 Career Mistakes to Avoid</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do not: 1) </span><span class="s1">Have a career in a field you’re not interested in, along substandard coworkers. 2) </span><span class="s1">Go into an established industry or a bureaucratic research institution. 3)</span><span class="s1">Take a monotonous entry-level job with low incentives for initiative (in exchange for a slightly higher starting salary). This is like shooting Future-You in the foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you can just stay away from these herd behavior choices, you’ll do more than fine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, if you feel like maximizing. . . </span></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s1"><b>High Probability Area of Success #1: Sales/Autonomy</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work in a small organization where you are given relatively free reins, so long as you provide results.</span></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s1"><b>High Probability Area of Success #2: Top-Tier Firm</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work in an esteemed corporation/organization where you can learn from some of the best in the industry and gain valuable insights not easily available elsewhere (this is what Nicholas did).</span></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s1"><b>High Probability Area of Success #3: Pioneer Path</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enter a new industry or field of research.</span></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s1"><b>High Probability Area of Success #4: Free Agent/Entrepreneur</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Become self-employed as soon as possible <i>if</i> you can combine it with maximizing your learning. </span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Part 2: After Age 30 You Want to Maximize for the Health of Your Brain &amp; Body</b></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“When I’m bored, my sense of values goes to sleep. But it’s not dead, only asleep. A crisis can wake it up and make the world seem infinitely important and interesting. But what I need to learn is the trick of shaking them awake myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1">—<b>Colin Wilson</b> </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><b>The Four Pillars of Wakefulness</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you meet older people—over the age of 50—the first thing you notice is their level of energetic vitality; are they wakefully alive and mentally engaged, or are they subdued and passive? The biological tendency is toward the latter, and the extent to which a person is able to prevent this decay has to do with consistent upkeep of<i> the four pillars of wakefulness. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The four pillars are <i>novelty, variation, randomness</i>, and <i>goal-orientation</i>. They are the main controllable forces which stimulate dopamine-release and keep your prefrontal cortex activated. They allow you to sustain a state of wakeful concentration throughout the day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s how I define each pillar:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Novelty</b>: Being exposed to new stimuli (people, environments, foods) or learning new things.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Variation</b>: Varying, changing, mixing, or shocking your routine behavior in some way.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Randomness: </b>Everything that manages to break the expectations of the neocortex’s predictive ability. Like humor or the unlikely outcome in a presidential election.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Goal-orientation: </b>Adjusting your behavior and delaying gratification in pursuit of a chosen outcome that is experienced as rewarding or meaningful. </span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i> [Your wakefulness and mental engagement can be likened to a temple held up by four pillars. If you do not tend to the upkeep of the pillars consistently, they will weaken and the temple will fall apart.]</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s look at how these four pillars act as strong motivators for different situations in ordinary life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1. Novelty: Why Kids Are the Pickiest of All Consumers</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guess which is the most fast-changing industry when it comes to product innovation? It’s not computers and microprocessors. It’s the <i>toy</i> business! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Children get bored quickly. They are picky consumers who don’t put up with the same toys for long. For toy manufacturers to adjust to this, and keep up the production cycle, toys generally come without a return policy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason children want new toys all the time is because their PFC is only in a rudimentary stage of development, with novelty being the main stimulatory force. When they get older, other functions—like decision-making and concentration—improve, and they become less reliant on <i>just </i>novelty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>2. Variation: How Christopher Nolan Got Famous Actors to Star in His</b></span> <span class="s1"><b>Movies When he Was Still a Nobody </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christopher Nolan is a successful director who knows a lot about making popular movies. For instance: He knows that movies are an economic gamble and that getting a famous cast is the #1 factor in determining box office figures. So he makes sure to get A-list actors to star in his movies: Al Pacino in <i>Insomnia</i>, Leonardo DiCaprio in <i>Inception</i>, Christian Bale in <i>Batman</i>. The list goes on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The question is: How did Nolan attract actors of that caliber when he wasn’t famous? He did it by targeting soon-to-be stereotyped actors and offering them a welcome variation in their work. (And probably also without them having to compromise their position by stepping down in pay-grade.)<br/>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those actors were BORED, but they rationalized their boredom as a necessary evil in order to maintain their esteemed careers. When they laid eyes on Nolan’s script, they thought, “Oh, this is a chance for me to remain as a lead, but try out something new and exciting, and keep from being typecasted!”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3. Randomness: Why We Don’t Want to Know What’s Going to Happen</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While we’re on the subject of movies, I should tell you that there’s a western film from the 90s called <i>The Quick and the Dead. </i>It features Russell Crowe, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, and a young Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead parts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The movie has a simple plot: You have a bunch of shady characters who’ve traveled to a western saloon town to take part in a dueling competition. Whoever draws their gun the fastest and shoots the other duelist wins the bout. Hence, the name of the movie.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes this movie stand out is its characteristic “bell-scenes”, which take place before each duel. And there are many duels, probably around 20. Now, it’s not that the bell is interesting in itself, but that its ringing sound becomes associated with the anticipation of not knowing what will happen next. <i>Every time the bell rings you wonder who’s going to die</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This type of randomness can be addictive. This is why Homeostasis Dwellers (who lack self-control) are drawn to slot machines, video games, gambling sites, online news feeds, and secret new methods of speculating in the financial markets. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s also why people like to watch sports—especially fast-paced sports like basketball, fighting, and race sports—where it’s hard to predict what’s going to happen next. The revenues of Formula One went down like crazy during the period of 2002-2003 because the viewers (correctly) expected Michael Schumacher to win every time, and stopped watching.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>4. Goal-Orientation: Why the Spartans Were Happier Than Many People Today Are</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In many religions, there is a strong tradition of asceticism. Non-thinking followers are led to believe that abstaining from their desires will lead to them becoming more “holy”, which in turn will lead to something good. But they’re mistaking the cause for the effect.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not that abstention and asceticism by default lead to a happy and meaningful life; it’s that having strong goals and convictions <b><i>allow for</i></b><i> </i>these things to become meaningful. This is because delayed gratification in pursuit of a goal stimulates dopamine to the prefrontal cortex. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So when people today look at the Spartans and think, “oh, poor things, to be forced to live like that!” they’ve got it all wrong; the Spartans had a strong culture, a simple hierarchy, and clear convictions. The more likely scenario is that they derived a great sense of meaning and purpose from their ascetic practices.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Also: When we think about the Egyptians—and what an achievement the Pyramids are—we should think one step further, and ask ourselves how they were able to construct a society where the belief in an afterlife was perceived as so meaningful that they willingly suffered the opportunity cost of having tens of thousands of slaves working on something non-productive for hundreds of years.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><b>What The Four Pillars of Wakefulness Mean for How You Should Live Your Life <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) </span></b></span><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Novelty: </b></span>Is most easily available when you’re young, but it’s available later too for anyone who has at least a modest interest in learning, traveling, and experimenting. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2) </strong></span></span><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Variation: </b></span>Is the easiest of the four pillars to tend to, because not only is it wholly under your own control, but it’s also the one that you’re least likely to engage in by default. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3) </strong></span></span><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Randomness: </b></span>Becomes less available the older you grow, assuming that you’re getting wiser with age. Either way, it’s hard to infuse extra randomness into your life in a healthy and sustainable way (you don’t want to watch sports or gamble, but you might consider becoming a venture capitalist). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4) </strong></span></span><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Goal-orientation: </b></span>Remains at about the same level of control all throughout life, theoretically. But, in practice, it’s easier for most people to come up with meaningful goals when they’re young and haven’t achieved much yet. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Important advice: </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><i>Make a list with these four columns and add items to it continually over time</i></span><span class="s1"><i>.</i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This is a natural way to increase your baseline levels of intrinsic motivation. It</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">s most important for people older than 35 and for those who sit by the computer all day and don</span><span class="s2">’</span><span class="s1">t get exposed to a variety of different stimulation.</span></p>

<p>Cool article! The second part on wakefulness made real sense to me since. When you start to feel “sluggish”, or “blah”, its usually one of these four things that needs to be tweaked to get you back to equilibrium. </p>
<p>Question on that point (assuming you’re taking questions) </p>
<p>How do you balance Novelty and Goal-orientation? </p>
<p>For example, when pushing towards a “goal” or “outcome”, and adjusting behavior / delaying gratification to reach it – many times you lose Novelty. </p>
<p>Especially when Novelty includes nice foods, restaurants, social activities, and things that are “fun”. It seems almost necessary to stop those things when you need to get something done (business launch, get to 7-8% bodyfat, run a marathon). And at points even the thought of doing something Novel is bad if goal isn’t accomplished. </p>
<p>I’m sure this is a common question – just interested to handle it. Obviously someone probably can’t maximize all pillars at all times – but then according to this view won’t the temple collapse?</p>
<p>Thanks again! Keep em coming.</p>

<p>“How do you balance Novelty and Goal-orientation?”</p>
<p>–I switch between what I refer to as “creative process” and “practical process”. Both start their own physiological feedback loop.</p>
<p>“when pushing towards a “goal” or “outcome”, and adjusting behavior / delaying gratification to reach it – many times you lose Novelty. ”</p>
<p>–True, but at the same time, delaying gratification in pursuit of a goal supplies dopamine and makes you motivated. The crux is: You must first gain a critical mass of psychological commitment to the goal.</p>
<p>“Obviously someone probably can’t maximize all pillars at all times – but then according to this view won’t the temple collapse?”</p>
<p>–It will be very hard if you don’t control your time. Someone over 30 and financially successful should answer this for perspective (how they handled it). Before age 30 this is not really a problem, because the brain has a higher baseline level of dopamine.</p>

<p>Fascinating article. I think a lot of the advice you’ve given with regards to becoming financially free relates to this article. That is, once you generate and hold onto several million in cash, you can invest in something “safe” that gives you enough money to live off (without touching the principle) so you do not have to do anything you do not want to. Once you’ve reached this level, you are free to pursue the 4 pillars. This is where life gets incredibly fun. Thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>I looked over that picture of young innovators again and the 2x rule. There are two paths that are realistic for me now and they are the finance path and the learning path. The question is how I can combine them. Maybe if I get the right transferable skills.</p>

<p>Big takeaways for me:</p>
<p>1. Four Pillars of Wakefullness: explains why I lost my “Spark” I had between 14-16. Now I have a framework to get it back</p>
<p>2. Cut down inputs(Info/Smartphone/Tech): destroyed my focus. You mentioned the Wealth/Health/Relationships framework, seen that mentioned allot recently in self-imp circles. Built a system around that</p>
<p>3. Allostasis: knew what to do, body/stress quit on me many thimes. This was an “Aha”” moment for me</p>
<p>4. Mental Models: self-reflection this year pointing at learning these. Also a good reason to read different things than self-improvement.</p>

<p>Ludwig fantastic stuff. And thanks WSP/mikael for coordinating with you.</p>
<p>You know lifestyle factors like intermittent fasting, coffee/tea/caffeine, and mindest (self perception) are HUGE enablers of a good, productive state..at least for me. I’m 30 now and can feel the difference in “fluidity” compared to when i was even 23. </p>
<p>But fasting (working in the fasted state), using coffee or caffeine. And training (different sorts of weight lfiting, calisthenics/gymnastic rings, olumpic lifting etc.) has created a very nice physiolgical state (body &amp; mind). </p>
<p>Curious to hear your views on this as well. It’s teh day to day habits that can compound results!</p>
<p>Also, I wonder if you could offer some commentary on which nations today are most “inundated” by this…let’s say comparing USA vs. Japan.vs. China. </p>
<p>I’m in tokyo currently and i can say that the MASSES are in desperate need of a dopamine fix. They are by and by robots…with the very few elite dominating all aspects. The hiearchy maintains status quo and “innovation”/ambition amidst the younger crowd is effectively stifled..while the old guard enjoys the fruits of their post ww2/80’s asset gains. </p>
<p>Contrast with USA’s “entrepenurial spirit” for instance or China’s rising growth/and populace’s beelif that they can be come #1. </p>
<p>Just stuff like this, demographics/nationality/social hiearchy or structure and what the renaissance man in each of these should do to optimize success!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hey Bob,</p>
<p>Not sure I understand the first question(s).</p>
<p>As for Japan, I spent a month there last year. I spoke to some people about the Japan WW2 thing and got two different answers: either they hated the U.S or they felt the older generation was slow to catch on. It’s a polarizing subject. Much like immigration policy in Sweden.</p>
<p>I haven’t been to China, but I’ve met plenty of Chinese people. My perspective of Japan is that their culture pays a higher tribute (respect and social status) to skill, beauty and mastery–even if it doesn’t produce money.</p>
<p>Having said that, Japan has some of the highest suicide rate out of any country among its “salarymen”.</p>

<p>Great article. This fits well with my personal experience. I fall into High Probability of Success Category #4. I never had ideal set of skills to compete with others in established areas or get jobs for which there was a lot of competition, so instead of pursued an industry with a great deal of global demand and a ton of niches that have not really been acted on. I used a number of years in my twenties to attempt to innovate solutions and a few times was able to achieve a level of invention as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’re never too old to learn new tricks, although obviously it will become harder with time. It wasn’t till I was 31 that I began the effort to learn how to be productive even when I wasn’t facing a strict deadline or lacked an immediate motivation to get work done.</p>
<p>Which is good, because as something of a late bloomer, there’s still a number of important skills that I’m going to have to learn if I want to capitalize on all the things I learned in my twenties.</p>

<p>Another idea, your brain is generally good at telling you which problems it wants you to solve *now* and which problems it’s ok with putting on the back-burner. Listen. And when you know the biggest problem, spend all your time and resources solving it. I’m only 23 but a lot of people I know either don’t focus enough on their biggest problem(s) or spend all their time focusing on one problem and don’t spend time on other things. Balance is needed.</p>

<p>Thanks for the post!  I will certainly read the book.  </p>
<p>I found item #4 in the after 30 category most interesting – that delayed gratification stimulates dopamine production in the brain.  Does our immediate gratification society also decrease dopamine sensitivity?</p>
<p>Again, thanks for the post, I look forward to reading the book.</p>

<p>Thanks Jason,</p>
<p>“Does our immediate gratification society also decrease dopamine sensitivity?”</p>
<p>–The simple answer is: Yes it does.<br/>
The longer answer is: If it lasts long enough the person will have a bad reward system (dopaminergic pathways). The stereotype of this is a girl who can’t go five minutes without checking social media. This results in desensitization and/or habituation, which makes variation extra important.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Nice article.</p>
<p>Mirrors experience. </p>
<p>Before Age 30:</p>
<p>In college, slacked off until graduation. Did not secure job out of college. Tried hand in entrepreneurship alone. Had no clue and venture failed. Dabbled in different fields as employee. Making little to no money, jobs sucked. Lots of failures. Life sucked. No matter what, learned something new every day. Read a lot. </p>
<p>A year or two after college, got foot into the door in field related to finance. Doing better financially. Miserable. Learning stopped and drowned my sorrow into video gaming. Life sucked. Had to get out and attempted to pivot after 2 years.</p>
<p>Landed into science field. Took 2 years to successfully pivot. Once in, lived and breathed said  field. First year in was awesome. Then it got less and less awesome. Sad. Needed back up plan. Got back to reading and learning something new every day. This period, mental growth went into overdrive. Learned psychology, marketing, investing, political science, writing, and everything else of interest in while keeping up with science field. Rapid mental growth, tried entrepreneurship again while in science field. Small success eventually. Gave up sleep, ate like crap, became fat, health took a dive. </p>
<p>Quit science field. Everyone shocked. Tried pivoting venture into something bigger. Could live off of income but got bored. </p>
<p>After Age 30</p>
<p>Went back into science field, specialized. Fell in love, found calling in life. Found mentors. Taking previous non-science knowledge, developed philosophy of life and success. Built up success system. Became one of the best. Still learning every day. Based on success system, improved every area of life: mentally, physically, character. Working on spiritually. </p>
<p>Reached point in life of position of power. Can go anywhere, high demand. Will not consider job unless at least $300,000 a year for 40 hours / week. Lots of offers. Expect double – triple after few years. Frequently wined and dined, recruited, butt-kissed. Expected for lynchpin / rainmaker. </p>
<p>Still becoming better daily. No days off. </p>
<p>Life just beginning. No marriage, no kids, no obligations, no shackles. </p>
<p>Career Mistakes Avoided </p>
<p>No top-tier firm. No pioneer path. </p>
<p>Engaged in entrepreneurship / autonomy. Autonomy key. Did own thing, experimented, failed, and recalibrated.</p>
<p>Four Pillars of Wakefulness</p>
<p>Think over-complicated. Novelty, variation, randomness condensed into avoid boredom. Avoid boredom combined with goal-orientation = key for deliberate practice. </p>
<p>Goal-orientation big part of life. Did not know about delayed gratification and dopamine but makes sense. Achieving end, beating game = boredom. No goals = boredom. One key of personal philosophy: always become better. Not frequently bored.</p>
<p>Overall, different sections of article all connected as per Munger. If lived, results in success in any / all parts of life. No paths of success same. Each must find own.</p>
