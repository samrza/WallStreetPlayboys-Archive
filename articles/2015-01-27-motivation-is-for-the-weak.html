Self doubt is normal. However. The need for motivation is for the unsuccessful. If you know someone who needs to be lifted up *emotionally* to achieve something… He never wanted it in the first place. He’s simply someone who wishes upon a star for the world to give him something he never deserved. Even worse? He thinks the emotional pump up is good for him.</p>
<p>The type of person who gets amped up by written words in a text book or a motivational video will scour the internet far and wide looking for a solution to his problems. It will never come.</p>
<p>He will attend seminars and speaking venues. It will never help him.</p>
<p>He will try to use the same ideas to sell to his peers. It will never work.</p>
<p>He’ll never find his magic product or service to sell. He’ll never succeed even in the slightest because he is unwilling to take risks. Perhaps, if he is lucky, he gets by on a middle class salary of $100K per year. But. He’s never going to accomplish anything meaningful. Period.</p>
<p>Knowing that most people love this type of inspirational nonsense, <em>many, many, many</em> <em>people become rich</em> by transferring this feeling to the masses. As usual, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190704205935/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/the-definitive-guide-to-doing-the-opposite/">don’t just do the opposite, </a><strong>be the opposite. </strong>Use motivation to sell products because people will make purchases when they are in a high emotional state.</p>
<p>Instead of nagging on and on about how weak people enjoy motivation (by definition they are weak because a successful person doesn’t need to be motivated) we’re going to give away a step by step process to rid yourself of the need for motivation. <strong>For free.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Stand up, Walk Out: </strong>Lets assume the worst. Someone reading this likely enjoys motivational speeches and other such nonsense. Time to throw away the crutch. Kill it for good. Choose a large, large, large venue (college commencement speeches and motivational seminars are good for this). Sit front and center.</p>
<p>You are waiting now. <strong>Wait until the crowd bends to his words.</strong> When the crowd is bending to his words you’ll sense an uncomfortable quiet and focus from those around you. This is usually just moments before the conclusion of the speech.</p>
<p>Stand up. Slowly. Walk through the crowd. Slowly. Never look back. As people stare at you, make eye contact until <em>they break first or you have walked past them</em>. Head straight. Do not look down. Time will slow as you feel the scrutiny from your “peers” weighing on your shoulders. <em><strong>You are not doing this for the attention.</strong> </em>Exit the venue.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this is <em><strong>not done for attention.</strong></em> When you are quizzed (many will ask) as to why you left at the “best part” simply say you had to use the restroom. An emotionless statement. Do not say anything negative or positive about the speech, remain in a neutral state (Ie: you’re not doing this to be a hater). Never mention the incident again.</p>
<p>What have you done? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You’ve taken control of your emotions.</strong></span> Congratulations. This is step one in your long journey to internal motivation. You will not bend to the words of others for “feelings” or “emotion” you will only listen to logic and reason. Most won’t be able to complete step one.</p>
<p><em>Example: </em>Here is a clear example of motivational junk that doesn’t help you. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Started laughing out loud at second 31.</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20190704205935if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-jwWYX7Jlo?start=31&amp;feature=oembed" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p>*Note 1: This is certainly rude. The one time event of learning to control your emotions is worth many thousands of dollars. Here’s a hint. The speaker has no interest in giving you money so it is going to be a great long-term investment for you. The only message is to work as hard as you can, no actionable advice is given beyond getting rid of your cell phone.</p>
<p>This video was found in a YouTube search and you can replace it with any other video. The inflection point is usually right before the conclusion which is always the same “work as hard as you can”. If you’re already trying your best then there is no reason to watch the video correct? Correct.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 – Testing Phase: </strong>The one time event above is going to give you more adrenaline than the entire speech. You’ve stood up against the largest enemy of all. The masses. Learn to control your heart rate and bring yourself back down to normalcy as fast as possible.</p>
<p>After taking a large jump towards emotional control, it is time to see what you are actually good at. The bad news? Time is not on your side (it never is). The good news? Everyone is good at something.</p>
<p>Find twenty five subjects that you are interested in. Since this blog is about making money, Wall Street and having fun we’re going to assume you’re more interested in the money part. Go and try all of them until you feel comfortable with the subject. It may take 4-6 months but we doubt it. You’re going to be good at some, terrible at others and have potential in *maybe* two of them. Check those two out.</p>
<p>How do you know the difference between good and potential? Other people will tell you that you’re good at it. These people will not be your friends and family, they will have businesses in the same field.</p>
<p>To conclude the testing phase, here’s the rub. Most people try to “do what they love”. This does not work. Almost everyone would love a life where they have sex everyday, get drunk and make a lot of money for doing nothing. Naturally, none of this is really going to get you anywhere. Instead of “doing what you love” find what you are actually good at first (maybe only a few things) then figure out if you can do it for many hours per day… bringing us to step 3.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 – Stress Testing: </strong>Stress test refers to stress testing your physical body. Step number 2 already determined if you have the talent/intelligence to be good at the task (remember other people will tell you that you’re good!). Lets assume you found two topics that you have a knack for. Time to stress test. Can you do this for 80+ hours a week consistently? Try it.</p>
<p>You try one. You find that you’re sick of it after a week. Complaining about the lack of sleep. Complaining about the types of people you were meeting. Complaining about the effort it took to improve upon your craft. Complaining about the process of setting up the business.</p>
<p>You try another one. You don’t complain about your lack of sleep because you wake up energized. Strange. You don’t complain about the people you meet, there are some bad apples but it is tolerable. Strange. You don’t mind the hassles of dealing with a miniature set of customers. Strange again. Strange that <em>you’re working the same hours but you’re not tired anymore. </em>You found a potential revenue stream.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 – Prioritize: </strong>So you’ve found one interest with revenue potential. Check. You’ve already stress tested yourself for 3 months or so. Check. Now it’s time to re-prioritize your life to go all in on your new found venture while maintaining a normal social personality. You can guess where we’re going with this.</p>
<p>You commit 100%. You care about every single detail. You do not cut any corners. You do not run in blind. You start building based on long hours of research and effort and commit every single ounce of energy into the project until you are beat. Now you’ve got 1-2 hours of leisure time and 6-8 hours to sleep… Remember step 2? This is how you avoid becoming a boring type A person who no one wants to hang out with .</p>
<p>Keep those fun ideas in your back pocket and they become your new source of fun/entertainment. You will go through phases and cycle through many activities where you’ll be “pretty good” and more and more people will enter your social circle.</p>
<p>Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Maybe you need an example. One is staring right at you. This blog. This blog falls into the hobby/entertainment aspect of life. While it has evolved over time as any hobby will, the chances that we try to build this blog up appropriately (see cater to the masses) is next to zero percent.</p>
<p>Alright, alright it actually is zero percent since we’re terrible writers anyway (too blunt and don’t cater to idiots).</p>
<p>Alternatively? We take our real side businesses (some smart readers already figured those out) and Wall Street work extremely seriously. You care about everything in that case. You care if the charts have tic-marks or not. You care if there is a typo on a slide no one will read. You care if you respond to a client in 90 seconds or 45 seconds. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Everything</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> matter</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>s.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 5 – Daily, Monthly and Annual Accountability: </strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190704205935/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/why-and-how-to-keep-a-journal/">This is similar to your journal. </a>If you’ve done the first four steps appropriately you won’t waste your time listening to speeches or reading insanely corny success stories. How does reading about the success of someone else without any actual *actionable* advice help you? It doesn’t. If you cannot apply it, you have wasted your valuable time. Again, if someone else has to get you to take action… you are going to lose in the ring<strong> <em>every single time</em> </strong>to the person who inspired you to take action! You do not read to take action… You only read in search of actionable advice.</p>
<p>No exceptions.</p>
<p>You write down your accomplishments, your failures (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190704205935/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/im-a-failure/">you’ll fail a lot!</a>) and your future tasks every single day. Every single month. Every single year. <em>You tell no one on a personal basis that you are doing this. </em>It is up to you and only you to hold yourself accountable and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">compare yourself to the person you were last year. </span></strong>(under no circumstances do you compare yourself to others, there is always someone better than you)</p>
<p><em>Example: </em>The easiest example is financial if you’re on Wall Street. You know the comp structure and you know what the Street pays. Luckily it is an up or out environment (you’re moving up or getting fired).</p>
<p>Analyst – Base $80-100K (100% targeted bonus) 160-200K (age 22-25)</p>
<p>Associate – Base $120-160K (100% targeted bonus minimum) $350-400K if you are promoted to VP (age 26-33, wide range due to young talent and MBAs)</p>
<p>VP – Base $175-200K (100%+, call it 125% targeted bonus) (age 30+)</p>
<p>Director – Base $225-250K (Variable call it 1.5x base salary target) (age 32+)</p>
<p>Managing Director – Base $325-375K (Variable, call it 2x base salary as a target) (age 32+)</p>
<p>*Note: Yes base salaries at the junior level are moving up a tad, call it $5-10K depending on if you’re an associate or an analyst. However, as the numbers show, your goal is to get promoted since the variable numbers become larger and larger as a % of your salary</p>
<p>If you’re not on Wall Street, try the following: make your income grow at a faster rate each year. <em>This is extremely difficult.</em> In simple terms, if you were up 10% last year, your goal is to be up 15% this year. If you are up 20% then you want to be up 25%. The “law of large numbers” works against you. This is the fun part of the game (it is just that, a game).</p>
<p>Finally, throwing income out of the equation, if you run into an acquaintance you have not seen for a year he/she should recognize that *something has changed*. Many times people cannot put their finger on it, but you are simply different (in a good way) compared to the last time you two spoke.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 – No One Cares About Your Career or Business: </strong>Most people talk about their work, career or business. Can it. Unless the person you are meeting can potentially help you in your venture, there is no point in giving people information about your life. When you are out once or twice a week since you earned it (from all of your 12-16 hour days) leave it all behind you.</p>
<p>This will work wonders for you. Most people dislike what they do so bringing up work in a social environment is a terrible decision. In addition, if people realize you’re happy with your life they will pepper you with questions and waste more of your time. It’s a lose, lose situation. You either kill the atmosphere, make the person feel unhappy talking about careers/work or you have a mediocre person trying to squeeze information out of you.</p>
<p>Remember, if you’re going to meet someone to discuss important topics, you’re not meeting them out and about on leisure time. To repeat… Can it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 – Repeat Step 2: </strong>Once you’ve squeezed as much as you can from one venture, it is time to move to the next. Do not let your life pass you by. Every year should be filled with interesting and new hobbies (see the attempt at 25 different activities) and ideas. If you think that the last year flew by, it means you were in a mundane routine. Do not do this.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 – Bonus Sales Tip: </strong>Now that we’ve basically killed the myth on motivational speaking and other such nonsense… You know what to do… <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190704205935/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/you-dont-want-to-sell-too-bad/"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Use it to sell. </strong></span></em></a>By definition, again, the masses love this stuff! If the masses love to be motivated and pumped up… Use motivation to sell more products and services! Get them amped up and feeling good about themselves then make the sale.</p>
<p>No we’re not saying you should sell BS products (you won’t last long in that case). Instead, make the connection that if motivation and pump up speeches are popular… You know the masses will buy.</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Remarks and the TL;DR Version: </strong>In short, motivation is a tool used to sell to the masses. If you can make someone feel hyped they will bend to your beliefs and convert (convert is basic internet marketing language for purchase). It is perfectly fine to use motivation to your advantage to sell products.</p>
<p>From an individual standpoint however… <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No one should be able to motivate you.</strong></span></em> You should be internally motivated to do well and the external motivators should be telling you to slow down if anything. People who are internally motivated have a problem of going <em>too far. </em>People who need external motivation have not even started in the first place.</p>
<p><em>The Bullets: </em>1) go against the grain in a large environment to take control of your emotions, 2) find what you’re good at – a long-term theme in this blog – no one can hold your hand through this process, 3) stress test yourself intensely and find out if you can actually handle 80+ hours a week – most give up after 50, 4) prioritize everything in your life to maximize your brain cells towards that activity, 5) hold yourself accountable on a daily basis and have an annual review – the harshest critic should be yourself, 6) leave all this effort behind you during down time, your brain needs to recharge and no one cares about your success, 7) repeat step 2, most people work boring 9-5 jobs so they do not know the difference between year one and year five.</p>
<p>We realize this post is going to piss off a lot of people. This is fine. We need to decrease the traffic here and get rid of the mediocre people who have found the blog. They can go back to watching motivational videos! We also noticed that someone else agrees with the belief that motivation is nonsense… naturally he’s a successful hedge fund manager with an 8 figure net worth. Go figure.</p>

<p>Oscillating is a good topic and cannot be covered in tweets.</p>
<p>Oscillation means that you are being tested. Instead of turning to external factors to push through the pain you need to look to internal factors.</p>
<p>Recall the last time you had a terrible life experience and had to overcome it. Get into that real life situation in your mind.</p>
<p>Remember every detail.</p>
<p>Your heart rate will rise temporarily and you will push forward. If this does not work you didn’t want it.</p>
<p>If you need a lower key simple example, use sports. Maybe you played in a big game. Remember how you felt at the beginning right before the fight, gun shot, ball tip etc. That is what you need to recall to push.</p>
<p>Do *not* go to an external factor for this motivation. It needs to come from you. Period.</p>
<p>If you continue to use external factors like motivational videos, you will be giving the wrong person credit for your success. The credit is all yours. Don’t let other people steal your Spotlight when all they did was yell at you to “keep going”. You don’t need that, you know it.</p>

<p>Sounds okay. I’m currently doing an internship with long days (12 hours is average) and during the rest of the day I’ve only got two hours to get better + Saturday and Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Luckily I leveraged my time during the previous years of college so I can achieve a lot in two hours (it’s project based).</p>
<p>Just a tip for anyone: Even if you only have one hour a day: Focus on the thing you really have to do to get better. If it’s a blog = write articles. If it’s music = finish the track. Keep your weekend for learning!</p>

<p>Looks like you are well on your way.</p>
<p>Most people forget to check both items off.</p>
<p>1) make sure you are good at it before you bother committing. Do not invest time if you cannot succeed in the space<br/>
2) keep trying new things. You cannot go longer than a month without taking a stab at a new topic. You have 2 clear hours each day to do this. Or even the weekend.</p>

<p>@WSP<br/>
True for both options:<br/>
1) Becoming good is part of the deal for everything. I explained this before in the Ask us Anything with my guide to start a business (Too bad it’s gone). You’ve got to become good before you start anything. If you would start anything and you ain’t top level you’re wasting your time and your customers time.</p>
<p>2) I actually do this during Sunday afternoon. I’ve a list of things I want to learn (it’s ranging from Photoshop to coding to learning/improving a language) and I spend the whole afternoon on it. It’s fun to focus a bit on something else and sometimes you will find new business ideas for the future!</p>

<p>I learned this the hard way. I had become complacent because I didn’t get “enough” motivation to do a job I was asked to do. At that time, it was a $43,000 mistake (but I’ve learned a lesson I’ll never forget so I guess it’s worth it)</p>
<p>First a bit about me: I run a restaurant that my parents started (yes, I do work 84+ hours a week). Long story short, we saved up enough money over the years to buy a multi-unit commercial building located near a university and we renovated the 2nd floor of the building to a 3 unit apartment for students. </p>
<p>It was mid October 2014, and a few months before I had just made the rebel choice to be an entrepreneur after graduation and here comes my chance to shine. I was asked to find tenants for 2 of the 3 apartment units for the next school year (if you’re not familiar with the college housing culture, basically from mid Oct to early Dec, students look for housing for next year) What was the first thing big-balls me did? I increase the rental asking price by $100 because recently college graduated me just did “analytics” and found out that the current price is about $200 lower than the average price of other units in the area. Then I posted on a sheet of A4 “for rent, call xxx-xxx-xxxx”, stuck it on the door and I waited. A few calls come in, I told them the price and the basics, then I told them if they want to see the unit, they can call the tenants themselves and take a look because “I don’t really want to go inside” and then I just wait for them to take action and call me back. On one unit, I was trying to find 2 roommates for this hot Russian girl who wanted the unit but can’t find roommates. On the other unit, a group said they really wanted it, so I emailed them the lease, and I waited for their reply. 1 week past and they haven’t answered so I emailed them; they say they’ll do it as soon as possible. While waiting, I turned down many many calls by telling them the place is almost leased and if they’re not a group of 2 girls looking for roommates, I wouldn’t consider them. Another week later, they haven’t replied, but now its mid-November and time was running out because by this time, most students have already found a place. So I panicked and naturally I told my parents about this. I suddenly realized how naive I was and how complacent I have been. So I told the Russian girl and the other group that they must find roommate/sign a lease in 2 days or else I’ll move on. They never did because they were never serious in the first place. </p>
<p>I ran back through all the groups I turned down and luckily, 3 groups said they were still looking. This time, I arranged the tours of the units myself and showed them the units myself. I got my hopes up, but ultimately, none of the 3 groups signed a lease because the units were too expensive. This time the truth gave me a knockout blow and I couldn’t forgive myself. </p>
<p>I was gutted, lost my appetite, became depressed and disappointed at myself because it’s a $43,000 mistake: 2 of the 3 units will be vacant next year. After this, I don’t know where to look, so I went back to the basics. I analyzed my life, weeded out bad habits and replaced them all with exercising/reading. After a week, I got my emotions under control and I learned a very important lesson:</p>
<p>If you don’t need to do something, you most likely won’t do it. </p>
<p>This is my long winded way of saying that if you need motivation to do something, then you just merely want to do it because in this case, motivation comes BEFORE the work. But if you need to do something, motivation will come AFTER the work. This is how you keep yourself motivated in the long run. You simply get excited about your progress and you can’t wait to go back and keep going up and up and up. </p>
<p>I will never make the same mistakes again because I just hated that feeling and I hated myself for accepting mediocrity.  I was a mediocre person, so I got what I deserved. But now, I finally started to work on my restaurant business the same way great artists work on their paintings: with an extreme obsession at every detail.</p>

<p>As usual, another great comment.</p>
<p>You already have it figured out! </p>
<p>All of the effort and attention to every single piece of the process is going to pay off. Just remember to keep your hobbies so you don’t become a boring person. That is the only real risk in the hard working lifestyls.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>On the general theme of self improvement, I’d like to chime in and suggest a method that has been working out for me so far this year: </p>
<p>Pick 3 things you want to improve on, that you will do for 30 days straight. If you miss a day, you start back at day 1. Yes, even if you’re at 29 days. After completing the 30 days of, you will either incorporate that thing into your life, or dump it completely, either one is fine. The important thing is to complete the 30 days. This is my current list for example: </p>
<p>1. Wake up at 5 am (back at 0 days for me. This is actually proving really difficult to do).<br/>
2. Shoulder exercises with rubber band x23 days. I will probably integrate this as a preworkout warmup when I get done.<br/>
3. Calisthenics workout x4 days (another one that I’ve had to restart several times). </p>
<p>I will soon be done with the shoulder workouts, and I will probably move on cutting down my cigarette smoking until I dont smoke a single one for 30 days. </p>
<p>Just some food for thought.</p>

<p>Sounds like this would work fine for  many activities.</p>
<p>Don’t know how smart it is to do shoulder exercises everyday though! (assume you’re talking about weight lifting)</p>

<p>After reading your post on doing the opposite this is exactly what I thought about, everyone loves these motivational quotes and seminars but I never actually got anything from them, I just felt good for a few days and put effort on a small idea but quit a couple of days later. This post makes sense, they use it to sell you something when you are pumped up “*emotionally*” as you guys call it.</p>

<p>I remember in one of your past tweets you said “motivation is an attitude” that notion did not fully make sense to me. I mean I am one of the guys that use to watch those motivational video every now and then.</p>
<p>However this notion was set in concrete a few weeks ago. I was taking a break from studying and then I came across a youtube video titled flyod mayweather  net 100 million + in potential fight with manny pacquaio. I was jealous here I am struggling to find a event driving skill that could net me a profit and this guys mayweather is going to have a 100 million + payday. But then I click on the video and watched mayweather, I watched his attitude,and I was ooh that why he is so successful. I was yeah WSB was right motivation is an attitude. Watch the end of the video from 2 mins, his entourage was trying to motivate him and he told them to pipe down.</p>

<p>Strong post. I check your pages from time to time. I used to watch maybe one of these videos every couple of weeks or so… but now I avoid them like the plague (probably largely because of the realisation WSP has given me). </p>
<p>To be fair, some of the videos contain some decent, actionable advice (said by successful people). However all the hyped up music, movie montages and all that BS do indeed degrade the value of such videos massively… Far better watching a simple one-on-one interview with a highly successful person, where you actually *learn* something.</p>
<p>Motivational videos are entertainment, just like watching sports actually – hyped up setting, living vicariously through someone else, escaping reality, etc. Like the stress test idea. I often think… if you need an alarm clock to get out of bed, even early, something’s probably wrong. I still keep one on standby, but when I’m passionate about whatever I’m doing, I wake up just before it goes off. Strange eh!</p>

<p>It’s funny how some people (and there are plenty) need to watch motivational videos before heading to the gym.</p>
<p>True motivation comes from within, and not outside sources. Once again I agree with your ideas.</p>
<p>It’s just how bad you want it. I no longer need convincing to work on my physique. This is the first area I can am 100% internally motivated. There is no longer any degree of outside influence required to get me in the gym for a workout.</p>
<p>I am working on other areas and raising my personal expectations in those places as well.</p>
<p>The good thing about the gym is that it has a contagious effect on other areas of your life. No wonder despite your heavy focus on writing about grinding and making money you still reference the importance of working out intermittently.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I love the post. Couple years ago I was reading a lot of self-help books and was a person with low confidence and a lot of insecurities. </p>
<p>Went for couple motivational seminars, had no money, so volunteered at them in catering, and what happens is this. </p>
<p>During the motivational seminar, everybody are hyped up, and with a lot of energy. We are brothers and sisters shitting all over about plans, how great it will be.</p>
<p>And a day after seminar your energy level goes down to a normal level, and you think I need to go for a seminar again or read the books, which where recommended by the people you met on seminars.</p>
<p>It’s good for the speakers and it’s a loss for masses. You buy a hope, which will never happen.</p>
<p>Now, I am just laughing at motivational seminars.</p>
<p>The real motivation is in yourself. Do what you want to do. </p>
<p>Get out of the comfort zone, be afraid, fail and be the opposite.</p>
<p>Thanks WSP ! Kudos for you</p>

<p>Yep you’re paying to “feel alive”.</p>
<p>This only works if you weren’t living a good life in the first place.</p>
<p>The bright side: 1) you don’t waste any more time getting pumped up by external people, 2) you never paid for the ridiculously expensive add ons</p>
<p>The biggest scam is that they target poor people… The result?  Makes them poorer.</p>
<p>—<br/>
Edit: probably need to take this a bit further. These seminars are bad for you because all it does is make you talk about all the “cool stuff” you’re going to do. As opposed to actually getting to work. Using energy to fuel emotion instead of action. Unhealthy.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I just want to reiterate what many of the readers of above stated. I really enjoyed this article, it actually struck quite the cord. You’ve been hinting at the senselessness of extrinsic motivation, so it’s finally good to read your full insight on the matter. </p>
<p>I’d like to add a question that hopefully doesn’t come off to idiotic. I’m currently on the path to obtaining a Wall Street Job, i’ve listened to everything you’ve mentioned and feel that i’m on the right path. While I don’t think anyone I know would call me a boring person, Step 2 of your actionable advice had me thinking that my life isn’t well rounded. When i’m not studying/ learning for classes, I either play basketball, lift, or go out on the weekends. Can you offer some suggestions for the subjects that you find people excel in?</p>
<p>The only other subject I have remote interest in might be Programming but I never explored this option because that is in essence another career option, and i’ve been focusing on just the one. Any input would be greatly appreciated, and continue to look forward to the insightful articles/comments.</p>

<p>Why can’t you learn programming? You don’t need to switch careers, you can do it on the side.</p>
<p>The only thing that stands out from your comment is your assumption that you don’t have other interests. This is false. You haven’t tried the things “you know” you won’t like.</p>
<p>That is the point of section 2.</p>
<p>Let’s say you know you “hate art”. Play a game instead. Get to a level where you are competent. This will take 1 month or so of effort. Now make a decision on if you hate it.</p>
<p>The point is that most people assume they will dislike XYZ task when they haven’t bothered to even learn it… This is equivalent to shooting a basketball once and deciding you are not good at it and don’t want to see if you can improve.  (Using your own hobby as an example).</p>

<p>Appreciate the quick reply.</p>
<p>I must have mistyped because my question gave the impression that I don’t like anything else whereas I meant what kind of subjects do you suggest people try to see if they have any interest in? As in Chess seems cool on a surface level but hours of testing in Chess will probably not yield any results masterful enough to leverage it as either a form of income or worthy entertainment *the stereotype being Chess players are usually shy/introverts*. But i do understand where your coming from. </p>
<p>For the time  being, I will begin learning programming on the side, and even try learning about art once comes. And hopefully I can find other things i have interest in.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the advice.</p>

<p>This depends on your goal. Do you need money or are you bored?</p>
<p>If you are getting bored definitely take up chess. Unless you’re elite then simply keep it as a random hobby (1-2 hours a week for a year). If you get sick of t just quit and try something new.</p>
<p>You’ll keep your baseline skills and it may come in handy.</p>
<p>In fact chess is great, met some interesting people in Amsterdam from that game. It is very popular there. Then… just got high and hit the club ha! (Story for another time – much younger back then as well)</p>

<p>Hi, do you think this idea has merit for watching my time? It’s simply time management… but more hands-on. Okay, that’s two puns already.</p>
<p>I’m getting a cheap watch that has a built-in stopwatch. My plan is to make sure I’m productive at least X hours a day (I’ve set the bar high for “X”). And I’m going to start/stop the timer whenever I start/stop being productive. Then I’ll track progress etc.</p>
<p>Seems like a good way to stay on track and remember not to get distracted… What do you think?</p>

<p>Ok thanks. Not necessarily “productive” in its purest sense, but rather “attempting” or working/pushing forward. I’ll get back in a few days or so.</p>

<p>Sounds good! If it works keep to it.  </p>
<p>Our guess is that if it does work, then it will become a habit to work X hours a  day anyway. </p>

<p>Just a quick update… I’m pretty glad I did this. I can keep track of my time literally to the minute. I’ve logged it every day. I’m at university currently and so I’m not exactly passionate about the BS work you do, but I’ve been strict with what I’ve been counting… right now I’m at 60-70hrs work this week (but I even turn it off to go to the toilet).</p>
<p>Looking to scale up to 80-100 hours and make that a habit… Anything below 70 usually results from getting sidetracked, and working 60 hours seems pretty lazy to me?</p>
<p>Overall I’m super glad I got it.. the watch is a Casio DB36-1AV which apparently lasts years, so I can see myself doing this for a long time.. It also helps you identify the BS that wastes your time.. You realise every minute spent in a crappy conversation with someone is a minute, well, SPENT i.e. lost. You just used some of your day’s time allowance to purchase a crappy conversation.</p>
<p>Hay, I won’t get too “type A” about this, but it’s useful. Thanks.</p>

<p>I learned to hate cheesy moto bullshit in the military. I would cringe every time I heard somebody say, “get motivated” or some similar moto bullshit.</p>
<p>Nobody really gives a fuck if you tell them the platoon’s goal is to have everybody improve their fitness scores. Nobody gives a fuck if somebody gives a speech about it. The only way you see results is if people adopt the goal for themselves. Once they start saying, “My goal is to improve to be the most fit guy in this platoon” you know they are internally motivated.  They have to adopt those goals for themselves, or they will forever be second-class.</p>
<p>That is also what separates Special Forces, Rangers, Seals, etc, from regular joes. The elite guys are internally motivated to be the best. The regular joes need external motivation to push them to do anything.</p>
<p>Great post.</p>

<p>I am 24, Asian who grew up in Eastern Europe, and studied Business Administration in Germany.<br/>
Public education in Germany is free and the quality of my university was high. My college years, were filled with studying instead of partying.</p>
<p>At the last year, when I was on exchange year in Warsaw, Poland started doing improv, and now I think that was a great decision. In the post regarding the race and the stereotypes, I also agrees that Asians should work on improving salesmanship skills.</p>
<p>Doing improv on the stage before people, and hard-working at the Uni with reading books on the side was the great thing. </p>
<p>I also did 4 internships, so got some experience.</p>
<p>After a year of doing improv, started doing stand-up as a hobby, and I believe those hobbies, at some day will help me with sales skills, so they will be money making machines.</p>
<p>And being Asian and doing improv and stand-up makes me more interesting person.</p>
<p>I work hard and will push myself hard for failures. It’s twenties time 🙂</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Anything that is extremely popular with the masses by definition caters to mediocre people.</p>
<p>While others like it, this is where we strongly disagree. If you can’t motivate yourself, you are  a lost cause and someone else will make money off of you by pumping you up emotionally and selling you something. </p>
<p>Again ask yourself. Does Tony Robbins need to be motivated or energized? Again… no.</p>

<p>&gt;You’re going to be good at some, terrible at others and have potential in *maybe* two of them. Check those two out.</p>
<p>&gt;How do you know the difference between good and potential? Other people will tell you that you’re good at it. These people will not be your friends and family, they will have businesses in the same field.</p>
<p>clarification question, by potential do you mean potential to be greater than just ‘good’ at it? i.e excellence?</p>

<p>Yep that is correct! When other people in the same field (already successful) tell you you’re good it means you have the potenial to be good enough to generate meaningful revenue.</p>

<p>Hi WSP (European reader here – Germany),</p>
<p>Thanks for the post. I follow your advice With a great deal of skepticism, but because most of its worked so far. I keep following. </p>
<p>Context: I’m an Engineering major. At a Top 5 school. Switching to IB. Your steps thus far have been incredible. I study and work on applications etc. On average 14-17 hours a day with ease now. My grades are much better, had interviews at the very best BBs Etc etc. Cut out bad habits. Things are going well. </p>
<p>BUT I feel I took your post on drugs far too literally. Anyway I’m too sensible and too broke to get addicted but I need a prevention plan before I enter Full time.</p>
<p>Ultimately the culture in the BBs in London has a large amount of this going on. And I know that ill inevitability be around this for the next 6-10 Years. I’ve seen some of the most impressive people become shadows of their former selves just a few years older than me due to this culture. (Keep in mind Europe finance is easier than NY / Asia culture).</p>
<p>Please are you able to write a follow up post or give any advice or taking up hobbies that don’t include expensive girls or bars. </p>
<p>I understand two of you made VP this year ? I aim to be in the same position in a few years time.</p>
<p>Except from the gym and formerly high level atheletics. I’ve realised I don’t have any hobbies that actually stimulate me. </p>
<p>What do you propose individuals do here that is actionable? </p>
<p>Basically what is a sustainable way to not go partying: but still (1) Maintain female relationships doesn’t have to be a crazy number. (2) Maintain success (3) Not be boring. </p>
<p>I feel you are in The correct position to give advice or even write a post on it. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>That is a lot of questions. Will have to think about it.</p>
<p>The drugs post is not meant to tell you what to do. It is just reflecting the reality. Many guys use them, you don’t need to do anything you don’t want to do.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Edit: no offense but if all the advice works, how can you be skeptical. We know it works because it’s exactly what you do to win. Ha! Really odd comment, but glad you are doing very well!</p>

<p>What? We have said many times if it doesn’t work just don’t read it.</p>
<p>The tone above is meant to be a joke. ie: it *really is funny*. Information here = impossible to fake. Therefore it is likely a passive aggressive comment.</p>
<p>It is a logical conundrum. If the information works how does that make you skeptical.You can *easily* check to see if we are legitimate by buying an interview guide, you’ll see the exact same stuff is provided for free here so you literally just wasted money. </p>
<p>If information does not work = yes be extremely skeptical. Most of the stuff we explain can be tested by anyone who has $10 in his pocket and working legs.</p>

<p>Long(ish) time reader here. As WSPs said: try it out. My conclusion from reading and trying it out: suspend your scepticism and just try it. It helped me move up the Finance ‘map’ (referring to a WSP article) it will help you too. Just suspend your beliefs and try it, if it doesn’t work you can always come back to your previous routine/thinking but trust me these guys are smart and they do give out some great advice, it sounds extreme because it has to be.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly. That’s why all people who ask for “studies” are losers. Can’t even take a zero risk venture of a basic attempt… they need to have some 500 page explanation proving it works.</p>
<p>Bad model becuase you never get an edge. You need to try new things and if they work… don’t tell anyone how you’re doing it’</p>

<p>Hi. I was going to partner with someone that involves importing from a certain country, and they have specialist knowledge in this area, however they don’t seem to want to help make sales…</p>
<p>Now I’m thinking it’s better to find another guy and pay them by the hour for their specialist knowledge instead of partnering with this guy and giving away 50% equity and not have to pay, thus keeping 100% myself.</p>
<p>Is my thought process sound? I’m implicitly valuing the sales effort way beyond everything else…</p>

<p>Ok. The guy wants to go in as a partner 50/50, but I’m just thinking his contribution could potentially be outsourced (he won’t be selling)… Just wasn’t sure whether I should value his contribution more.</p>
<p>I will also say it’s practically guaranteed I will be putting in more hours, but I doubt 60/40 would be diplomatic or well-received…</p>

<p>I realise that I can’t expect someone else to tell me what I am interested in but honestly I am STRUGGLING to come up with 25 subjects. Further to that, the things that I have come up with so far, Rugby and investing (WSP have previously stated this is a waste of time without a substantial portfolio), don’t seem particularly monetisable / stress testable. </p>

<p>I wasn’t clear, apologies.</p>
<p>The reason I “think” these things aren’t the best route is because I *have* tried them.</p>
<p>Rugby – played in secondary school, tried to pick back up after Uni but working in IBD meant I couldn’t commit to training or match days. Was planning to start some kind if blog but after evaluation, didn’t *seem* like a worthwhile path.</p>
<p>Investing – IMO and in my experience spending a few hours a week looking at a security and I may understand it in 6 months – didn’t strike me as the best way to build a portfolio.</p>
<p>RE your post on striking balance, I have explored those areas</p>
<p>Team Sport – Rugby<br/>
Language – Speak Spanish and refresh it on the commute to work<br/>
Performing Arts – Tried acting at the beginning of the year</p>
<p>That being said, there are multiple streams within each of those areas that I could still explore. Might as well give singing a go, will be a laugh if nothing else.ha</p>

<p>You provide solutions.</p>
<p>You say something along the lines of:</p>
<p>“Getting annoyed and frustrated is a normal part of the process. Getting annoyed also accomplishes nothing. So let’s figure out a way to solve issue XYZ.” (Start brainstorming)</p>
<p>If they decide to complain anyway. Just console them for a few minutes. Be nice, lift their mood and never contact them again.</p>
<p>Smile, nod, be positive… Leave.</p>
<p>If they want to complain they are useless anyway. Don’t spend your time being a cheerleader. </p>
<p>If you want to take care of your family and they can’t take care of themselves. Then you need to succeed yourself. If they aren’t motivated then they won’t make it anywhere.</p>

<p>Said hedge fund manager also believes in aiming low and taking very small steps to get started (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190704205935/http://alwaysbebrucewayne.blogspot.com/2014/08/aim-low.html" rel="nofollow">http://alwaysbebrucewayne.blogspot.com/2014/08/aim-low.html</a>).<br/>
In my oppinion that’s actually a form of motivating yourself. Arnold Schwarzenegger does the same. He wrote about it in “Education of a bodybuilder”. I also realized that the most addicting computer games work this way. At the start it’s easy and you get quick rewards. Then the difficulty increases incrementally. But once your hooked you keep grinding even if it’s very hard to get a reward. You are internally motivated. But if it was hard at the start you would just quit right away. When I aimed very high at stuff I didn’t like, for example boring university courses, I always ended up procrastinating. But small steps seem to work.<br/>
What do you think about this strategy of starting very small and then just incrementally increasing difficulty. Is that also for the weak? Should I just start bigger and try to fight through?</p>

<p>Small incremental steps work for hobbies (weightlifting etc).</p>
<p>When it comes to making money… It usually pours in. Huge difference.</p>
<p>Just think of the masses and you know the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Masses = want one quick trick to change their body… Therefore better to think incrementally.</p>
<p>Masses = think getting a 5% raise each year will make them rich… Also never happens, so you know when the money comes in that it pours in. Felix Dennis explains this in his book. It is true.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply, appreciate it. I wouldn’t transfer that to getting rich through saving or incrementally making money. More like, if you start with sales for example, to start small, selling items that are easy to sell and then incrementally increasing the difficulty until you finally make a lot of profit. I’m not expecting that the income will also incrementally rise with your skills and think it’s more abrupt.<br/>
I saw you guys mentioning “Stack that money” once. Since it is very important to get legit information: Would you recommend that site? Or would you rather read a book about copywriting if you have no online sales experience?</p>

<p>We have a post later today.</p>
<p>In short your assumption on selling small then selling big doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Now we’re talking about making money. So find a way to automatically scale = money flows in.</p>
<p>Or find a way to sell one huge item with a set percentage commission= again one time money flows in.</p>
<p>Small incremental steps = poverty mindset for making money.</p>

<p>I think you actually have a different definition of “motivation” and should maybe rather write something like “motivators are for the weak” or “motivational pop culture is for the weak” because I think the title is a bit misleading. Motivation definition from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>“Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behavior. It represents the reasons for people’s actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one’s direction to behavior or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. Motivation can be looked at as a cycle where thoughts influence behaviors, and behaviors drive performance, performance impacts thoughts and the cycle begins again. Each stage of the cycle is composed of many dimensions including attitudes, beliefs, intentions, effort, and withdrawal which can all affect the motivation that an individual experiences.”</p>
<p>Sounds a little bit like sophistry but I do think there is often miscommunication based on different definitions of terms so I thought I’d point that out. I for example was immediately disregarding techniques to control your emotional state and remain a positive attitude as I also related that to motivation whereas you were probably just talking about the guys telling you to get fired up and keep moving.<br/>
Just pointing that out how I view it. You are already pretty busy and producing amazing content so if you think this is just sophistry just ignore it 🙂</p>

<p>I’m not sure I get the point. What you mean is that if you’re not motivated by a certain task you’re doing the wrong task? I’m studying finance and most subjects are insanely boring to me and I procrastinate and don’t put the amount of work I would like to be putting in. Are you saying that this is unsustainable in the long run and I should study something different or try to make money from something I’m good at?</p>
