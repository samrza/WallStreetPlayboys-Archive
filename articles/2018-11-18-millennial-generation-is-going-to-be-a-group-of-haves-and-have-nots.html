It’s an interesting age group as a chunk of them graduated only to see the Great recession and the ones that are even younger on the age bracket are racking up Student Loans at an alarming rate. We had no idea that 80% of the entire millennial generation had less than $9,999 saved. This is a startling number to say the least. In fact, all it does is prove that small amounts of entrepreneurship is the best way to go, asymmetric risk is the name of the game if someone’s net worth is that low. In this post, we’re going to outline our own strategy if we had to start over again and also outline benchmarks for multiples of annual spending that someone should have saved (by age).</p>
<p><strong>Ignore the Macro Picture: </strong>At the end of the day, the macroeconomic picture doesn’t mean much for you. If you have no money, having your net worth go from $10K to $5K… is not going to change your life. That’s equivalent to about three months of unemployment checks. Don’t worry about things that are out of control since you’re essentially starting from zero. The only way to take control of your life is to have individual value that cannot be replicated by a machine. So instead, as usual with this blog, we’ll focus on the microeconomic picture and how to fix your own situation first. Fixing the world is something you can noodle on when you’re rich.</p>
<p><strong>Microeconomic Environment: </strong>There is no nice way of putting this, unless you’re able to make the median wage which is around $50-60K a year… You don’t deserve to have any fun. Those invites to get drinks and travel are officially canceled. We’ve seen a lot of young people party hard in College only to end up with no job offers, debt and a belief that life is exciting and fun with no repercussions. As they say <em>“life comes at you fast”.</em> If you can live at home… Do it. If you can’t find the cheapest possible place and get your income up by working two jobs if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Living With Nothing Sounds Terrible: </strong>Yes it does! It’s terrible because the situation is essentially a war zone. People have a hard time thinking about compounding and losing a single year in your 20s with no money means you typically have to work multiple years later on in life. Want to put this in perspective? <em><u>If you saved one year of living expenses today… or you saved 10% of a year of living expenses for <strong>~17-18 years straight</strong>… you’d get the same rough result.</u></em> That is mind boggling when you think about it. It means you’re better off throwing money into investments all at once and early. Much better than the ridiculous strategy of saving “10% per year” forever.</p>
<p>For the people that love numbers out there, we’ll put some realistic money to work. If you were to save $50K in a single year or $5K per year for 17 years straight… the person who tossed in $50K would now have $157K and the “consistent” saver, would have $154K. If both people were age 23 when they started it means they are both 40 years old with the exact same net worth. Insanity. As you can see this is an obvious set up for our argument based on <strong>*event*</strong> income.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Over, What to Do: </strong>The answer is always the same: asymmetric risk. You have to start numerous online companies, consulting companies… hell… even a blog generating a few thousand bucks would be fine because you have zero dollars to start with anyway. This is exactly what we would do. We would take a look at three types of work: sales, entrepreneur and services. The last one is a change of tune from our normal advice since the person is falling behind every single day. Services is an area where you can make well above minimum wage and is also an area where automation is unlikely in the next 10-years.</p>
<p><strong>Services Jobs:</strong> What is a services job? It is a job you accept as an absolute dead last resort. <strong><em><u>You go to dead last resort positions when you’re falling behind.</u></em></strong> Falling behind is defined as your net-worth no longer tracking to the numbers at the end of this post (net worth relative to annual spending). Services positions that have good paying incomes include: nurse, air traffic controller, plumber, technicians, auto mechanics, electrician and more. If you get good at any of these things that also funds a low-income blog about said profession: You Tube videos on fixing stuff essentially.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Into The Numbers: </strong>Study this chart and take it seriously. Since you’re reading this blog we sure hope you’re not interested in saving 10% of your income and retiring at age 65. The goal is to get rich ASAP and leverage your time since money is always going to be there anyway. It is certainly a lot easier to sleep at night when you’re not worried about paying bills that’s for sure.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200120175035/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Untitled.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4088" height="275" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200120175035im_/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Untitled.png" srcset="https://web.archive.org/web/20200120175035im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Untitled.png 627w, https://web.archive.org/web/20200120175035im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Untitled-300x132.png 300w" width="627"/></a></p>
<p>The chart is clear as day but we can assure there is no confusion. If you spend $50,000 per year, it means that you want to have ~$500,000 by the time you’re 30 and $1.25 million by the time you’re 34. Like everything else in life, if you’re making smart decisions your income actually grows exponentially and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200120175035/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/when-does-the-snowball-effect-occur-short-musings-on-momentum/"> your net worth ends up generating large amounts of money for you</a> ($70,000 is just 7% when compared to $1 million dollars). We use 21.5x total living expenses as a rough proxy for when you should feel “set”. To wrap this up, we use multiples since we have no idea where someone lives. Perhaps you can live on $30,000 a year and feel great… Others might need $120,000 per year. That’s not as relevant as the multiple since it adjusts for this naturally. In short, if you’re behind on this graph it’s time to delete everything: Facebook, Twitter, “beer nights with friends” so on and so forth. If you’re on track with this graph feel free to do whatever you like since the difference between being financially set and financially set times 1.5x or 2.0x isn’t really going to change your mental health much.</p>
<p><strong>Just Get Over the Hump: </strong>The numbers look daunting since they accelerate. The reality? If you get over any of those bars earlier it means you’ll blow through the next several years. For instance if you had 10x your annual spending at age 28… you would hit your number at age 31 without contributions (simplistically, assume 7% returns which adds 0.7x incremental at 10.0x). Putting it another way, all you really need to do is “generate income to survive” if you’re able to get over the hump earlier in life. Just like physics, objects in motion stay in motion… applies to finances as well.</p>
<p><strong>Front Load All of Your Work: </strong>One of the interesting conclusions from this math we’ve done is that you’re better off shoving all of your work into the beginning of the year instead of spreading it out through the full year. Why? Well you can hit your needed investment amount then forget about it. Lets say you’re behind and need to put away $40,000 (we made it up), well your best option is to live like a monk for the first half of the year working like a dog and then when you clear it you can forget about it like a bad dream. This creates a forced acceleration effect. If you’ve already hit your needed investment amount it is unlikely that you’ll go negative for the remainder of the years. If the prior statement is true then you’re going to be well ahead of all the bars listed in the graph above. Unsurprisingly this is exactly how we operated before becoming financially independent. Try to generate as much possible money in the first 6-8 months of the year and then move into relaxation/fun mode for the last 4-6 months.</p>
<p><strong>Moving onto the Fun Stuff: </strong>Well if you’ve been following along for the past 5-6 years you already know that less than 1% of people will ever listen to the advice on this page. They are more interested in watching Sports, Netflix and debating politics. Since we know two things: 1) millennials are broke and won’t have many options and 2) the richer part of the population is getting older… this creates a pretty big business opportunity. The two options are essentially hedonism and healthcare.</p>
<p>Millennials are going to spend all of their money as they view their future as bleak and impossible to overcome. Even though math says it is possible, they are more likely to spend their money on life experiences. This means travel, alcohol, concerts etc. Similarly, their income will go up so you can imagine that more and more foodies will make a good living in the future. On the other side of the equation is the aging population. The people in their mid-60s will spend large amounts of money on healthcare, travel and potentially dining as well.</p>
<p><strong>Massive Inequality:</strong> Think about it like this. The number of people willing to work hard is already around 10% maximum (hard work meaning solving problems not something worthless like working long hours). In addition, 80% of people are already behind and have to play catch up. This means you’re left with around 2% of the population to compete with (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200120175035/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/two-ways-to-view-the-path-to-millions/">10% times 20%</a>). We didn’t even adjust for people with low IQs, people with immense amounts of debt or people who have already hit age 30 with next to nothing to their names. Oh and by the way… many of the guys who are on track now will likely suffer a divorce or another major emotional mistake setting them back as well. This means you’re going to see a big big gap between the rich and the poor going forward as <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the rich people will be the only ones with an ability to produce.</strong></span></em> Attempt to have wealth redistribution, we wouldn’t even mind. Why? In 10-years the picture would be the same since the number of producers would be small at under a few percentage points versus the consumers with no tangible skills to earn money (only able to spend).</p>
<p><strong>Positive Note: Since this has been a bit of a sadder post we’ll have our Q&amp;A on Tuesday the 20th. Remember the only one you should look out for is yourself. </strong></p>

<p>Great post. An honest kick in the ass for anyone that falls on that chart. </p>
<p>Clarification: Do you guys assume that anything outside of living expenses (Living + basic fun if you’re in line with the chart) is just put into an S&amp;P index fund and assume 7% returns over the long haul on that chart? </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Not related to the chart, if you have 25x living expenses you’re set. You can put it into a mix of bonds/stocks/RE. Assumes you’re not a fool and put all of it into one asset class.</p>

<p>I know I’ve said this before on Twitter…making 100k+ is cake. </p>
<p>If you have no skills, work in the oilfield. Multiple jobs in it pay 90K+ only work 6-8 months a year. Paid housing and food when you’re working. Working 25 days a month will limit how you spend your money so you’ll save plenty. You can visit parents or friends when you’re off. Not paying rent is the best thing, because you save over 15k easily and can travel if you wish. Focus on building your biz on your days off. </p>
<p>Some of my coworkers spend their money and lose their stuff during downturns because they’re dumb with money. Other guys are HS drop outs have multiple homes for rent or multiple18-wheelers and are about to focus on their businesses full time. Some guys I know have limited English or felons, yet make 150k. </p>
<p>You don’t need a college degree to make 100k, just work ethic. 12 hours days in -20 or 120 degree weather will at the very least motivate you to take action. </p>
<p>After a while I grew to loathe people my age (mid 20s) because all they do is complain about lack of opportunities or how things are expensive….yet when I mention solutions they say “but not everyone can do that”. Yes they can, I couldn’t swing a hammer but necessity taught me. It’s how that Project Pat song goes “she don’t wanna be saved, don’t save her”; we can’t save all of these millennials.</p>

<p>Gotta love the oilfield, that’s exactly what I did, spent 13 years doing that from age 20-33 started with swinging a sledge hammer and when I quit last year I was managing a rig with  25 guys, Spent most of the money I made over the years on rental properties, that allowed me to quit and focus on what I want</p>

<p>i think a lot of millennials are banking on this great wealth transfer from their parents. also i think that a lot of them value spending $$$ on experiences over investing because they have been taught that “living a fun life” is better than having.$$$ in the bank i.e “you cant take it with you” . and too many are living about their means and on credit and having college loan debt.</p>

<p>A solid post. The bar chart is ideal, but as a middle millennial I can tell you most of them reach 30 with a 0 (if not in debt).</p>
<p>For me too, there is no way I reach these numbers the next couple of years, but I have betted strongly on event income, which means I might fall behind until the year it hits.</p>
<p>So, I think it’s not possible to both take heavy asymmetric risk and match the bar chart.</p>
<p>Then again I don’t live in the US, so things there might be different.</p>
<p>The picture you draw about millennials sounds about right. Full on travels, experiences, pets.</p>

<p>As a “screwed over hard on paper Millennial” I’m doing the following:<br/>
– Learning copywriting from scratch, writing a book on what I’m Learning<br/>
– Doing a podcast, documenting my Journey<br/>
– Investing Money in going to Conferences and getting myself out there<br/>
– Purging my social media accounts, ridding myself of all dead flesh like Stalin did in the Moscow Trials<br/>
– Eating healthy, working out<br/>
– Devoting ONE part of an evening every week for social events so that I don’t lose totally focus. </p>
<p>To say that my mind has shifted and that I now see how dumb most People are is an understatement. So much lost potential in the world.</p>

<p>Solid post, enjoyed it. Early 30’s, was worth over $2M about 5 weeks ago and now about 1.88Mish as the majority of my savings is in equities etc (with less than 10% of my NW in pre tax accounts/ 401K)…so i guess most would feel like I “made it”…However, as someone who wants to have a family and lives in the NY area I feel as if I need to continue on the gas and keep pushing for a very long time. Additionally, despite the average savings for millennials being shit, I am just an average successful finance guy relative to my social circle and clients. We can’t even afford a sick nice house or apt in the city. My wife and I have a relatively modest lifestyle for NY standards (need less than $150K annually) and my wife loves what she does and wants to work forever. Theoretically, I could “retire” as I would have hit my 25x assuming we need $150K annually and my wife makes $70Kish. We would basically have thit the 25xish for the remaining $80K.</p>
<p>One variable is that I don’t have a second form of income (side biz/website etc) outside of my public investments etc. The onus is on me to  to continue grinding and working in finance if we want to continue saving anything etc. Having a family will likely incur some additional costs, but assuming I can generate an additional 10ish% of my NW annually through saving and investments I should be good to go plus 5M in a decade or longerish …seems like forever  and by then who knows what our expenses will even look like. I know that’s a ton of rambling, but my poInt is that I have “made it” by most standards and would have 25x my personal expenses saved, yet still feel very far away. Like everything, it’s all relative.</p>

<p>I really wouldn’t reinvent the wheel and would likely echo WSP’s advice.<br/>
Additionally, I’m not sure I’m necessarily qualified to give advice, but my nearly $2M in savings is just the byproduct of living well below my means, aggressively saving, and being the benificary of a massive bull market. I never deprived myself of anything I really wanted, but I also never indulged in major expenses (watches, expensive cars, lifestyle RE etc) that some of my friends did who were making less than I did. All of my savings found a home in equities for the most part. </p>
<p>I made considerably less than you when I graduated undergrad and still make just under $500K even factoring in my wife’s modest income. </p>
<p>I guess you really have to figure of what kind of life you ultimately want and that should essentially dictate your career trajectory/choices. With your meaningful  income, you won’t  have to work too long if you only want $5Mish assuming your diligent about saving/investing. Computing interest is extremely powerful.<br/>
I realize I am never going to get “rich” on my current path as I am saving low 6 figures a year. Additionally, there is nothing sexy about it as I’m working for a large company within finance. I kind of got spoiled (perhaps no different than your situation) with really solid income and a comfortable situation so I never meaningfully looked for other opportunities or entraprenship/side hustles etc.<br/>
You have to ask yourself how important it is to you to ammas xyz dollars as your current situation guarantees you a 7 fig NW in a decadeish assuming you make prudent decisions.</p>

<p>Basically moving into the future, the value of labor will decrease even more, the value of real needs will decrease even more, and people will spend whatever money they have on artificial needs.</p>
<p>So if you can create a new artificial need by being good at selling, then you can exchange it for value from society and use that to enjoy your life or shape society to your vision.</p>
<p>A big example is Apple, which has hundreds of billions of dollars worth of value because of their brand. People want it just because it exists.</p>
<p>So essentially, find a “need niche” or create one, and then fill it.</p>

<p>I’m 24 in tech.</p>
<p>I kind of wonder if there’s a misdirection happening at each stage. In HS, everyone needs to focus on college admission but no one does. In college, you need to make 150k minimum out of the gate or your screwed. People think 100k is ok when it’s nothing especially in ny. </p>
<p>As someone who has 1 5 yoe, the current goal of all around me is promotion (I work in a very bonus driven company). At least now the goal is directly making money (bonus/promotion) but trading time for money vs scaling… </p>
<p>It’s like a magic trick</p>

<p>Absolutely spot on. I am a millennial myself (31) and feel almost no relation to my generation because they cannot turn off social media, feel the need to show off their newly purchased outfit hovering over endless plates of sushi, or cannot turn down the call for beers. </p>
<p>I particularly liked your call for front end loading of your savings in the year. Another advantage (on the upside of course) is that you have more time for it to grow in the year. </p>
<p>Being $116,000 in student loan debt has still kept me in the majority of millennials (I’ll be done in four months however because I follow your principles mentioned above), but don’t fret knowing that the right habits have been instilled in me. </p>
<p>Kudo’s for yet another gem of an article. I’ve sent this to many of the type you’re referring to.</p>

<p>As a 1997-born, I envision all of this becoming true and I appreciate the detailed layout which will help with structuring my future plans. After quitting pot and getting my **** together, I realize how much time millennial waste (Netflix after work/casual drinks/excessive partying/solely working a 9-5) and it is insanely obvious that there will be a massive wealth gap. Cannot fathom becoming average like the masses. There will be a big separation between the people that create value and the people that want things for free in life. In North America you can be rich at any age you so choose, you just have to do the right things and have a strong work ethic.</p>

<p>Young people who come here are blessed, fortunate, to have a blog like Wall Street Playboys. Didn’t have this when I was starting out. Nevertheless, I am catching up. My goal is getting FU money!<br/>
Wall Street Playboys is valuable. Even as a late bloomer, you are never too old to be a pimp. This blog helps. It is gold. And in January 50% of my debt will be gone. Thanks to what I learn here.<br/>
Thank you a million, probably more!</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>I was talking about this with my friends the other day, the workplace is where the differences in performance materialize, yet many kids today think it will be fun and games.</p>
<p>In high school you had the A+ kids (top performers), who maybe got a PS4 from their parents at most as a reward. Then the kids who constantly failed (bottom performers.), who maybe got grounded periodically and had to do summer school. Their lives were relatively immediately unaffected by their performance.</p>
<p>Fast forward to my current sales role:<br/>
I was told that within a year I could be in a position where If I excel in my numbers I could double my paycheck, and If I fail and miss my numbers I would make a lot less than base since base gets cut to accommodate for commission(not to mention I would be on watch to potentially be terminated.) The extremes are very real, yet those who are used to being underperformers in life will have to break out of that habit quickly, or suffer the consequences, while top performers will reap the benefits very quickly.</p>
<p>Not to mention that millennials today have the opportunity to save up a significant amount without sacrificing their lifestyle If they get smart about it. </p>
<p>Many tech companies are offering remote jobs (huge in sales.), the same can apply If you own your business and find a way to operate the business remotely. This can be used to your advantage.</p>
<p>I will give you an example My base+bonus is $67k out of school in Dallas, which literally gives me the same quality of life as roughly $120k in NY according to numbers I ran on cost of living comparison services (confirmed by friends who currently live there.) Not surprisingly, salaries in cities like NY is higher, but often not enough to close the gap, leaving people living a more limited lifestyle.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, If you find a company/clients in those areas who allows you to work remotely, you could be living in a relatively cheaper city, collecting a higher paycheck than you would by working locally.</p>
<p>This gives you 2 key advantages:<br/>
1. Lower cost of living allows you to invest more to reach the numbers listed above.<br/>
2. It will make it more bearable since you will be able to have some degree of fun in the process (a night out might cost you $30 vs. $100 in NY)</p>

<p>I am sure it varies, but I will put it to you like this:</p>
<p>-I am paying no state tax(NY and Cali get screwed more than anyone.)</p>
<p>-I am living in the Trinity Groves area(nice newer part of town, 5 minutes from uptown and American Airlines Center.) on a 1×1 by myself for $1400($1200 if i factor in the 2 first months free offer.) I am sure in NY would go for $2500+. I am looking to potentially have a friend move in, and rent could go down A LOT. ($1650 for a 2×2.)</p>
<p>-Traffic is pretty tame for a city that big. (I commute 20 miles and it takes me roughly 50 minutes If I leave in the middle of it.) That gives me great mileage, not to mention that it’s very easy to find free parking. That makes it convenient to drive home.</p>

<p>Thanks for this post! The skills I have are rarely mentioned on this blog (music) but have enabled me to bring in an easy $1,000+ per month (career-style) on top of my middling day job (~60K) while also having a good time and getting useful experience. I’ve started building a business with these skills as well. My living costs are quite low. Health = quality of life, and music = source of meaning and opportunities to grow when everything else in life is stripped away. I’d always thought I’d be a rich man this way but never gave much thought to the money side of things for ego-driven reasons.</p>
<p>I’m behind the curve with 0.5x saved at 25 years old due to bad decisions, but am poised to catch up to the chart at 27 years old. This blog really is a saving grace in the boiling bloodbath of millenial chaos. Really like Karl-Mikael Syding’s blog, too.</p>

<p>I’m 23 and a mortgage broker in the UK and can confirm – the average millennial financial situation is fucked. It’s staggering how obsessed they are with owning a home often putting in the minimum deposit leaving no cash savings and a whole load of credit card, bank loans all on top of student debt.  I’ve seen people with as much debt as they’re annual income and still want and get a house! Sometimes I ask what they spent it on and is always holidays or a wedding etc. *side note* seeing an awful lot of female clients with Ms as a title as well at the moment under the age of 30.</p>

<p>Millennials are poor as hell. They literally live this dream world. Their having some fun now at the bars 3 times a week and living pay check to paycheck. But once there on universal basic income in 5 years. They will be miserable.(Techies excluded)</p>
<p>Gen X is broke too. They can’t pay off their house and getting hit from insurance,health, debt, kids,gas,food..etc. They will never retire, and cannot adapt to chaning technology.</p>
<p>their kids:</p>
<p>Gen Z is going to be gouged by hedonism, no job market, and 100k student debts.</p>
<p>Any guy age 20-35 right now is prime position to establish themselves, even if your late to the game.</p>
<p>A decade from now a rich male under 60 will be a modern day noble.</p>
