</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p style="text-align: left;">This is a blog dedicated to helping YOU make more money. Most websites are written to sell lies about how to earn a living and instead we outline everything we possibly can without giving away “the house”. If someone has a specific business that runs well the last thing they’ll do is give it away (they will happily sell you on becoming a customer though!). Overall, most information is written by people who haven’t been there before and we draw a cutoff of $1M+ net worth to post on this website (yes we have met a few high profile bloggers in person and vet all posters). Importantly, we think everyone deserves a *framework* to getting rich (yes that includes YOU!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“</em><em>Well done is better than well said” – Benjamin Franklin</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TOPICS COVERED<br/>
</strong></span></p>
<p>The goal of this site is to provide *actionable* advice on 1) Life, 2) Personal Finance and 3) Wall Street. This is not a place for people who are driven by emotion, people who need excessive hand holding, or people that need <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127202640/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/motivation-is-for-the-weak/">“motivation” to get started</a>. In addition, many people have read between the lines and understand that selling *recurring income* products online is the key to making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127202640/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/money-making-machine/">significant amounts of money</a>.</p>
<p>To reiterate. This blog is not for people who believe they are average or regular. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you believe you’re average then how will you succeed?</span> </em>We want to help those that are *willing to help themselves*. These people will win. We believe everyone deserves access to the tools for success. What you do with those tools is entirely up to you.<strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127202640/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/1-million-10-years-zero-excuses/"> Anyone can go from average to a million dollars!!! </a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127202640/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/how-much-should-you-be-worth-many-paths-to-becoming-a-multi-millionaire/">more!</a>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Life: </strong>This is an extremely broad topic and we receive readers from a wide range (15 to 50 years old). Overall, there are really 3 keys to happiness.</p>
<p>1) How healthy you are. Are you healthy mentally, physically and spiritually?</p>
<p>2) How financially free you are. Do you work for money or does your money work for *you*?</p>
<p>3) How is your social life. Do you have friends and are you happy with your relationships?</p>
<p>Life is certainly complex. But. If you can answer positively to all three questions… you are likely happy. You worked extremely hard and earned it.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Finance: </strong>This is an extremely touchy topic. Ever since you were born you have been fed a lie. Work for an hourly wage, save every penny like a monk and pray you can finally “live” at age 60+. In short, personal finance advice is bogus (including frugality) because you’re better off working long hours which factually sends up your savings rate. We are tackling this topic head on. If you’re looking for the overview, simply memorize these three beliefs:</p>
<p>1) You absolutely must find what type of intelligence *you* have. Leverage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127202640/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/what-type-of-intelligence-do-you-have/">this type of intelligence</a> as much as possible.</p>
<p>2) The only way to get *wealthy* is to start a company. The only way to become *well off* is to go into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127202640/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-choosing-a-career/">Sales, Wall Street or Silicon Valley</a>. The fastest way to stay poor is by trading your time for money (hourly wage). No one gets rich this way.</p>
<p>3) If you are worth less than $1M there is no point in trying to trade the financial markets (hedge funds, quants etc. will eat you alive). You simply dollar cost average into an index fund for a decade or so. If you want to trade the market? Make sure you are *financially independent* at minimum. Then we do not care what you do with excess cash since you don’t have to work for a living. “Never risk more than you are willing to lose”</p>
<p>4) Importantly, for those that are serious about developing multiple streams of income and a high net worth, we can recommend <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127202640/http://personalcapital.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=4&amp;aff_id=1342">Personal Capital</a>. </strong>The Company offers *free* software tools with the following four key features: 1) ability to <em>avoid losing money</em> by tracking all fees associated with an investment product allowing you to choose the best possible fund for your future, 2) portfolio analysis where your risk profile is stacked up against your current age and retirement goals, 3) in addition to these free tools, you can also track your net worth and path to becoming a millionaire and 4) when you hit $100K in networth you’ll receive a free one time consultation with an investment professional at Personal Capital. After linking up all of your accounts you’ll be able to sit back and watch as your net worth goes up and your fees remain minimal over the next several years. We strongly believe that Personal Capital is the premier personal finance software tool when compared to its competitors such as Mint. If you’re looking to avoid personal financial collapse, it makes sense to track everything in one place for *free*.</p>
<p><strong>Wall Street: </strong>Most advice on the internet is also bogus. Primarily written by people who have never worked in a front office position.</p>
<p>1) Do not bother spending $500+ on financial modeling courses. Wall Street has company specific templates and if you process instead of learn how to model… You will make significantly more mistakes than you should (unable to think and are simply going through the motions).</p>
<p>2) Wall Street is extremely competitive. People are also human. You must learn how to work the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127202640/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/office-politics/">politics in an office</a> to give yourself an edge over the competition.</p>
<p>3) Once you are financially set, please do not work for a team or group you do not like. There are a lot of terrible people in the industry. You do not want to work for them once you have already *paid your dues*. It is simply not worth it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>READERS, COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS<br/>
</strong></span></p>
<p>If you leave comments that are of low quality they will be ignored. Your comments will be marked as spam or deleted. We delete comments since it lowers the quality of the blog. Historically, we allowed everyone to comment. But. That changed when the blog’s traffic started to increase materially. Most of our readers are incredibly bright and ambitious. Since we have an intense monitoring system for the comments here is how *you* benefit.</p>
<p>1) We no longer allow low quality comments and offer *free* Q&amp;As on Facebook once and a while which are announced on our twitter handle.</p>
<p>2) If you leave a bad comment it does not mean you are banned for life. We believe people can change. In addition, if someone goes from leaving good comments to bad comments they will also be deleted. The best example of a bad comment is one that is entirely unrelated to the post (example: Wall Street specific post with a comment on sports) or a comment that makes it 100% clear the post wasn’t even read.</p>
<p>3) There is no gossiping allowed. If you want to talk about other people on the Internet… do that on a forum. Not on our blog. If you want to promote your own blog, that is fine. However. You must be the actual owner and writer of the blog.</p>
<p>4) complaining is no longer allowed in the comments, we will delete them going forward as it adds no value. Everyone loses including the person leaving the comment (negative spiral).</p>
<p>The advice here is direct, blunt and to the point. <strong>*YOUR*</strong> time is just as valuable as ours. It is the only asset we never get back. There are lots of rich people… But… No one lives forever. We save as much time as possible here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“It is better to be punched in the face with the truth than kissed with a lie”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome and good luck! If you grind it out, you won’t need it!</strong></p>
