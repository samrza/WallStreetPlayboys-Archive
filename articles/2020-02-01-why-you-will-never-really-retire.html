<p>The reason is actually quite simple. If you become
successful in life, you’re a person who enjoys becoming better every single
day. You don’t enjoy sitting around drinking a bunch of beers and eating French
fries for 10 hours straight in front of a TV screen. You enjoy getting better
at *something* every single year. It could be your physical fitness, your
online business or your ability to read social situations. No matter what, you
find an area in which your skills are lower than you want them to be and look
to improve that area of life.</p>
<p><strong>Small Differences: </strong>As
you get better and better at what you do the number of people you compete
against gets smaller and smaller. The level of competition needed to get into
the top 10% or so is incredibly weak. We have only been writing for a short
period of time (in the grand scheme of things) and we have an inbox full of
people who made it through various routes: real estate, investment banking,
online business etc. They are now hitting a point where each jump is harder
because your competition is actually legitimate. You slip up once and you’ll be
passed immediately. Below is an email we received that highlights the change in
pace (redacted his personal information).</p>
<p><em>“About three years ago I decided I would give the information <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210122091938/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/efficiency/">from your book Efficiency</a> a try for a full year. I was working at accounting firm (redacted) and followed the plans to try and get into investment banking while improving my fitness since I was slacking after college. People don’t tell you how much harder life is after college since you are trapped in an office for a large period of time. Fast forward a year and I got into investment banking and made just over $110,000 while I lost over 10 pounds of fat. Sure it wasn’t a major change like some of your other readers but now I’m on track to make $200,000 this year with a small business on the side. What I noticed is that it’s getting harder to move up since the people I have to compete against are actually trying just as hard as I am! Do you have any advice for staying on the course when you visibly see the difference?” </em></p>
<p>We do have an answer here. The answer is this <em>“what else is there to do?” </em>This is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210122091938/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/the-five-rigged-games-in-life/">another rigged game in lif</a>e. Once you get into the top 10-20%, you know what it feels like to succeed and there is nothing that comes close to that feeling. Not even close. So instead of asking us how to stay the course ask yourself <em>“What else can I be doing that I won’t regret in 5-years?” </em>You’re going to come up with nothing. Your other options are boring things like drinking with your “buddies” who are low value and have time to waste on just “hanging out” and giving up to live a life you left behind already (clearing $70-90K just getting by). Both options should make you feel sick.</p>
<p>The real issue this person is struggling with is the *small
differences* issue. This is why we gave away our PED routine (already regret
that one). If you get to the top 10% or so, it’s going to be a large number of
small choices that will make you jump into the top 5% and beyond. Small
differences include: 1) do you check your website design every month or every
quarter?, 2) are you able to go to the gym 5 days a week instead of 6 days
while seeing the same performance improvements due to intelligent training?, 3)
are you pushing off those email responses to “tomorrow” or are you doing them
all before you go to sleep at midnight? and 4) are you still holding onto some
people that you know won’t make it as they have given up or slowed down for
good? </p>
<p>These are things that don’t show up for months/years at a
time. As you know (if you’re improving), all results take long periods of time
to show up. If you are a millionaire at 30, it’s because of the decisions you made
in your 20s. Now that you’re competing against other millionaires… You’re all
making long-term bets and battling it out to see where you land at <strong>age 40… Not age 33. </strong>So. You have to
stay the course and make tons of small difficult decisions even if your energy
levels are lower and you’re feeling tired. These will add up and you’ll
continue moving in the right direction. Besides, what else are you going to do?
Just drink and hang out for 40 years? No thanks.</p>
<p><em>“I have ‘Like Minds’… Do we have time to socialize and to hangout aimlessly? No. Do we want to do that? No. We want to work. I enjoy working”</em> – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210122091938/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/quick-post-on-kobe-bryant-the-result-of-incredible-work-ethic/">Kobe Bryant</a></p>
<p><strong>The Self Fulfilling
Prophecy: </strong>One of the best things about your first major win (like the email
we highlighted above) is that you *should* get addicted to that feeling. The “should”
part is important as it’s a quality of a future winner anyway. If you remember
that high (how you felt at that point in time), it should be impossible to
replicate. This assumes you really did something that you didn’t think was
possible within your time frame. </p>
<p>If the above is true then all you have to do is remember how
it felt and ask yourself if it’s better to give that up for good. Your answer
is always going to be no. Sure. You may not get the exact *same* high every
time, but it sure beats any other high you will get in the future. This is also
why we acknowledge that practically every single one of you will go through a
bender phase after you get rich. </p>
<p>In rank order in terms of dopamine rush: 1) financial
independence, 2) 50% change in your annual income, 3) first real profitable sale
in an online business while you’re sleeping, 4) one time windfall of 3-5% of
your net worth or more. The last one is critical, if you’ve trained your mind
correctly you won’t be excited by one time windfalls (lottery or a great stock
option call) and you’ll be more excited by the recurring revenue (items 1-3). </p>
<p>As you can see we do have one big concern we bring up
consistently on this blog. The recognition that it’s difficult to maintain
motivation past the financial independence level since the dollars don’t have
as much meaning behind them anymore. The good news? After your first bender (or
five), you’ll have nothing else to do. And. You’ll focus on the second option
again which is increasing your income or net-worth by another 50% which shouldn’t
be easy at all.</p>
<p>As another note, you get to a point where “hanging out” just
doesn’t sound appealing anymore. Sitting around watching something on a
television with 5 other people doing nothing every single week gets incredibly
boring. It’s actually more enjoyable to sit down and read something that will
improve your life. A few hours (maximum) per week hanging out is beyond enough.
Why anyone would enjoy hanging out with their friend every day after work for
5+ hours is incomprehensible (everyone in the room is quite literally getting
worse).</p>
<p><strong>Even At Old Age: </strong>Whilewe’lldo everything in our power to slow down the ticking hands of time,
even at old age, there are things you can do to improve. Maybe you’ll be less
interested in your own net worth and you’ll change your focus to charity, your
kids and some sort of elaborate bucket list. The end result is still consistent
interest in improving your life. By this stage in your life, you’ve tattooed a
habit of self-improvement onto your bones and there is no going back. How
anyone can live life hanging out and “chilling” doesn’t make much sense since
it’s incredibly boring to you anyway. </p>
<p>As a note, if you look at the ultra-wealthy, many of them do
things such as consulting/advisory services. They sit on boards and work less
hours while focusing more on high-level strategic changes. They don’t bother
with any more work that would be considered “grinding”. You become more of a
speaker/influencer at that time. </p>
<p><strong>“This Sounds Terrible”:
</strong>We do get some emails that effectively say that “this isn’t worth it”. This
is great as we can instantly ignore them and never speak with them again. They
gave us a great gift! They let us know up front that they will never make it in
life. A deleted contact is gained time in many cases. You can work with winners
instead.</p>
<p>When we read this post we’re actually excited. There is
nothing fun about sitting around. Going to the gym hitting a new “personal best”
or having a personal best revenue day is *really really really* exciting. That
is something that normal people cannot relate to since they haven’t felt it
before or don’t think it’s worth it. If it were possible to generate sales 16
hours a day and go to the gym for 16 hours a day we would do it. Unfortunately
that isn’t the case. </p>
<p>So with that we’re only focused on the winners in life. If
you ever feel like quitting instead of watching some crazy motivational video
talk to yourself rationally: <em>“What else
can I do that I won’t regret in five years”</em>. You’ll be back on your
computer sending those emails within seconds. </p>

<p>Wouldn’t that contradict itself with the passion vs money thesis. If that’s the case what is the point of picking the sales job instead of let’s say something less lucrative but more fun?</p>

<p>No because winners enjoy winning more than stupid stuff like “passion”</p>
<p>We have said the same numerous times on this blog and twitter over the past 3 years or so </p>

<p>Spot on as always, gents. </p>
<p>Efficiency changed my life since launch day. I refer to it every 30 days to stay on track. I’m a small fish compared to most on this site (local brick and mortar w/online services) but I’m bootstrapping my way out of the middle class trap thanks to this site and its content! On my way to creating a product to license out to larger companies. 2020 is my year.</p>
<p>Infinite thanks from a serious, obsessive go-getter NOT in banking or finance (somehow, right?!)!</p>

<p>In life I go through periods of spartan like discipline but then I run into these patches where I act very “average”. I believe this is due to a lack of congruent life philosophy. When it gets really hard you start thinking that it does not really matter how much money you die with or how many of your goals you achieve – you will die anyways, might as well enjoy it.</p>
<p>I am interested in hearing philosophies of other people who manage to keep going 365 days a year and why they believe in skipping 0 days and getting after it even when it gets super difficult.</p>

<p>Thanks for the content as always. Early 30’s, worth 2.5Mish, all self-made through finance job and investing my savings over the last decade. I had one very large lump-sum windfall (high 6 figs) and that high lasted about a year. I’m now just kind of grinding and the high is over…I’m only saving like 8% of my NW, despite making $500k annually, that does not include my investments erc so don’t feel like I’m really moving the needle all that much by working. I have to keep going though bc life ain’t w a fam. Thanks for all the content.</p>

<p>I know this website is mostly about making lots of fucking money, but it would be interesting to have posts on the psychology of Americans and the different “tribes” that you’ll meet from your point – you have touched on these in previous posts. I’m not from the US and all I know are stereotypes from movies – e.g. Wall Street banker, California surfer dude, Silicon Valley geek, etc. If I meet someone from my country it’s quite easy for me to “place” them regarding social status, income, attitudes etc., but if I was to meet an American I wouldn’t really be sure where to start.</p>

<p>I have thought about this myself. The issue is that it is hard to create tribes because America is such a huge country. </p>
<p>For example, there are a ton of wealthy people from middle america who are ultra conservatives who are stealth wealth. They have a mc mansion and a nice car but you would never be able to guess that they were multi millionaires because they are not flashy at all. </p>
<p>Then there is the factor that most major american cities are international cities where anyone from anywhere with massive wealth can move to. </p>
<p>You’ve also got major demographic shifts between locations. For example whites from NYC are mediteranean looking and whites from Seattle are more germanic/WASP looking. Latinos from LA are mexican and those from Miami are more cuban/south american. It’s very hard to group this many people from so many different backgrounds.</p>

<p>Taking a lunch break and catching up on these articles.</p>
<p>Great stuff, It’s funny how true all this is.</p>
<p>Some younger people reading this who spend a lot of time socializing, might think to themselves “but I could never give up on my friends.”  Well first off, if you place socializing above working toward something, don’t worry, you won’t have to give up your friends, most of ’em will be hanging around for the rest of your mediocre life.</p>
<p>But if you’re actually driven, yet do genuinely like some of your crew it’s not always a “me or them” type situation, it’s more that over time your friendships will evolve. WSPs have advocated deleting numbers (and there are definitely times when this is necessary), but as it implies in this article, the culling of the herd happens naturally once you really start grinding.</p>
<p>As someone who did a lot of socializing (partying) during high school, college and as a young adult, it wasn’t like one day I woke up and thought “F*ck these fools, I’m out” (too be honest I was probably a worse influence on my friends, than they were on me).  It was just once I found my hustle, I didn’t have as much time to screw around and the enjoyment of getting ahead changed what I thought was fun.</p>
<p>So over time I stopped “chilling” with people and only really stayed in touch with the friends with whom I shared (constructive) interests with.  So while the quantity of time I spend with friends is far less, the quality is quite a bit higher.  </p>
<p>Even now that I’m not working as much as I used to, my criteria for getting together with people hasn’t changed a bit: what can getting together with this person accomplish? Once in a while it will be purely social (take a walk or go get a drink type stuff) but after an hour or so I’m usually good and ready to move along, regardless of how fun/interesting the other person is.</p>
<p>So if anything people should be happy, if you grind it doesn’t mean you have to give up on everyone around you, it just means that the limited amount of time you have for socializing combined with the achievement = excitement mindset you’ll develop will require you to be more selective of who you hang with and what you do together.  </p>
<p>Side note: one thing driven young people often do is get it in their head that they should start a business with their friends “cause we get along so well and have this great idea.”  This is almost always a terrible plan.  You should start your own business and as you grow keep an eye out for other successful people in your professional orbit who have something you lack. Maybe there will be an opportunity there.  Leave your drinking buddy from the next dorm room over out of it.</p>

<p>Welcome back and agree with all of this.</p>
