In other words, a “temporary relationship” or a “mini-relationship”. Most guys learn game to get into serious relationships, so you can apply the same rules to your longer term relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Ground Rules: </strong>Assuming you’ve found a girl you would like to spend time with, it is smart to lay ground rules early. You don’t need to hand her a list like you’re talking to Santa Claus but… the general guidelines should be laid out. Everyone is going to have a slightly different set of rules but here is a good starting point.</p>
<p><em>General Guidelines for You</em></p>
<p>– Will only see each other 2-3x per week at maximum. 2x per week will be the norm, 3x in a week if you have been out of town on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190705214726/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/are-you-really-maximizing-your-time/">business trips/other ventures</a></p>
<p>– Short hair, flip flops, tattoos and bad hygiene are all grounds for a break up</p>
<p>– Weight management should be intact, ie: if she’s a size 1 and somehow tries to go to a size 4 there is an unwritten rule that you’ll be moving on</p>
<p>– There will be no wiggle room for being a cheat/liar. If she is not loyal then you leave</p>
<p>– She should have a high sex drive, this is dependent on you but if you’re not having sex every time you see each other… There is a problem.</p>
<p>Before all the negative comments come in about “what is in it for her!” or “You’re selfish!” we can go ahead and line up some clear positives for her.</p>
<p><em>General Positives for Her</em></p>
<p>– She is not going to pitch in for food/going out expenses. Going dutch is for broke people and hippies. If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190705214726/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/financial-goals-for-an-ambitious-male/">you can’t afford the extra $50-100</a> for an outing at night (skinny girls don’t eat much) then you shouldn’t spend your time maintaining a girlfriend</p>
<p>– Feel free to chip in on appearance improvements. IE: if she needs to go to the salon or buy some new lingerie, you shouldn’t be sweating the extra $50-100 here and there. Again, you both win here. She looks + feels sexier and of course you’re going to find her more attractive.</p>
<p>– Improved health, you’re not going to let her eat potato chips and Kentucky Fried Chicken all day. Instead she’ll be exposed to a healthier diet chock full of seafood (salmon, crab, lobster etc.), fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>With the ground rules out of the way, lets take a look at additional ideas on how to find a girl that will work for you.</p>
<p><strong>1) </strong><strong>A Common Healthy Hobby: </strong>This is going to be important for both of you. While sex is great, you should have at least one activity that you both enjoy doing. This does not include getting black out drunk. Some of these ideas can be simple: Tennis (mixed doubles), a Musical Instrument, Dancing, Surfing or Art. By having at least one common hobby you’ll avoid the constant need for alcohol.</p>
<p>A running joke… Every relationship after the age of 21 is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190705214726/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/dating-life-for-the-average-man-in-america/">spent drunk 24/7 with your partner</a>. Don’t be that guy.</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong><strong>A Common Healthy Entertainment Option: </strong>This one is similar to comment one, the two of you should have a non-alcoholic entertainment option as well. This does not include sitting at home watching TV as that can be done at any time. Some quick ideas include: A specific concert/music group, Theatre, Opera, a Sporting Event, Comedy Shows.</p>
<p>Now that you have both a common activity and entertainment option, you will have two forms of entertainment to fall back on.</p>
<p><strong>3) Distinct Personality Type for You: </strong>This is going to differ for each guy, but you should have a clear preference for personality type X. For fun, here is a personality type that is great to be around (opinion):</p>
<p>Flirty, Bubbly (ie: happy/ball of energy), Dainty, Warm Hearted, Sensitive, Sexual</p>
<p>Naturally, no where in this personality type does “intelligent” or “smart” appear since both of these qualities are usually accompanied by a dramatic decline in looks. Not worth it and certainly not fun to date a smart/sassy (see b****y) girl. Finally? God bless your bank account if you’re dumb enough to date a feminist.</p>
<p><strong>4) </strong><strong>A Separate </strong><strong>Goal: </strong>This will differ from girl to girl but she should be working towards something she wants/desires that is unrelated to your work/life. As an example a girl could be interested in cosmetics and spend her time getting an extra credential to work as a make-up artist at a high-end boutique (naturally this is not the correct way to state it but you get the idea). Alternatively, she could be interested in selling clothes or being a promoter. Regardless of the goal, it is something you won’t have to help her with, you’ll simply be supportive and tell her to “go for it” and encourage her through the ups and downs.</p>
<p>What is the trick here? If it is in the exact same field then you’re going to be in trouble. You’ll be competing (more or less) and it won’t end pleasantly. By the way… this is reason number 7,528 to never date a girl on Wall Street.</p>
<p><strong>5) </strong><strong>The Right “Look”: </strong>This is similar to the personality type. The girl you’re with should have the look that you “go for”. For some people this is the blonde hair &amp; blue eyed look, for others it could be olive skin, jet black hair &amp; green eyes… etc. Essentially, your type should not be compromised. If you compromise? You’ll lose attraction for her in a meaningful way… and in short order.</p>
<p>As a side note, no one has a type that is “plus sized model” that is a myth and is just a gross fetish that should be punished with a *fat tax* (pun intended). Both the plus sized model and for the guy willing to date such a monster… should be taxed.</p>
<p><strong>6) A Decent Family: </strong>Now we’re getting into the tail end of the relationship. You should have a firm grasp of her lineage. If her family was healthy and happy then chances are, your girlfriend is going to have a healthy attitude towards a relationship. Do not jump into any sort of commitment if the girl is part of a broken family where both parents are in jail and she is constantly being put into uncomfortable and painful situations.</p>
<p>There are always exceptions, but you should have a firm grasp of where her morals/beliefs stem from.</p>
<p><strong>7) Socially Aware: </strong>The last item on our quick 7 point list is a girl who is socially aware of how to behave/dress for an occasion. The last thing you want to do is bring a girl with you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190705214726/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/cliff-notes-for-evaluating-a-city/">Vegas or Miami Beach</a> wearing a thong and cut-off T-shirt that says “Come Party with Sluts”.</p>
<p>As a hilarious side note, a t-shirt that says “Come Party with Sluts” or “Slutty Saturdays” is not uncommon in the party scene. Just don’t commit to these girls (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190705214726/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/no-marriage-pitchbook-project-two-chainz/">heaven forbid marry one of these things</a>), hook up and move on.</p>

<p>Dating a girl on Wall Street is honestly awful. It turns into complaining about work 24/7 or having ridiculous conversations about prestige.</p>
<p>Not to mention the worst downside of all. *Rising expectations*. Much rather date a girl with low expectations so she’s happy than date a girl with sky high expectations and complete 100% knowledge of your bonus range. Simply speaking the truth.</p>

<p>You do this for you.</p>
<p>Act like a dumbass around men. Even if you have a good job. Say you are a freaking administrative assistant. Not only will it get you paid for everything (which we know damn well you can afford) it avoids you having to talk about yourself in a way which actually matters. </p>

<p>This entire back and forth explains exactly why it is of no interest for a successful guy to date a “Smart Career Girl”</p>
<p>1) They are angling. Even though WallStPlaygirl is giving good advice on how to scam the guy… That’s exactly why a guy should have no interest in dating a “smart” girl<br/>
2) The girl is more interested in her career than she is in keeping up her appearance = turn off and not something the guy is interested in<br/>
3) Reiterating the same point, she has high expectations for going out expenses and what you will purchase for her</p>
<p>This is why if a girl has a solid career, you just go for one night stands and move on. IF she’s young and just out of college you can consider dating her for a longer period because she’ll be fun, bubbly and entertaining while not breaking your bank account in half.</p>

<p>Incorrect, can guarantee you a model spends significantly more time on her health than any Wall Street Girl.</p>
<p>Fitness routines, make up, all the cosmetic items etc.</p>
<p>Most girls on Wall Street gain 10-20 lbs by the time they are 3-5 years in.</p>

<p>thank you @WSPB<br/>
1. 😀<br/>
2. I am quite interested in my own look….i feel better when i look better..but agree, no way i would have the same time to spend on apperance as a non-IB bank.<br/>
3. maybe not. Most things i want or restaurants i want to go, i can afford myself, so don’t really expect the guy to “open my eyes” in that sense. Actually picnic date in the park/outdoor hiking would be more interesting for me. But guess this message of me doesn’t come across clearly enough.</p>
<p>On the career point i agree. Sometimes im just a bit too focused on work/study like that;s the only thing on my mind. 🙂</p>

<p>Aka…you want to know what he does because that way you know how much to expect. Can he take you out? Uber you to a restaurant, pay for dinner, pay for drinks, have a gift for you, and Uber you back home?</p>
<p>The moment he realizes you are just an “administrative assistant” he will not ask you questions about your job, and it goes without saying you will have no money so he will have to pay for everything. </p>
<p>Who the fuck wants to reveal where you work and what you do? And do you think he gives a fuck? No! LOL. Administrative assistant, HR, jobs everyone knows what they are and won’t ask you anything more. If he does “equity” right there you have an idea of how much he makes. Only matters so you can get free shit for the sake of not paying yourself and being entertained for the night.</p>

<p>Hilariously good advice. Get them to believe you’re in HR.</p>
<p>Ie: play dumb.</p>
<p>Also agree if the girl knows anything about “dcf models” or “accretion dilution” that’s a turn off in multiple ways</p>
<p>1) she has an idea of how much you make – could be a hard core stab you in the back and steal your bank account numbers gold digger<br/>
2) she is not willing to play the courting game – not able to have small talk<br/>
3) will annoy the crap out of you when she tries to give her opinion on your work/career – no dude wants to talk to a girl about his career. Least no normal guy who doesn’t have Down syndrome</p>

Haha, “gold digger.”</p>
<p>“normal guy who doesn’t have Down syndrome”<br/>
Haha, “down syndrome,” why do we always have to go to the extremes? Hah.</p>
<p>That sounds like our normal shit-talking texts.</p>
<p>Seriously, the only people who should know what you do are your intellectual friends, the people who you work for, and maybe your parents if your job isn’t too complicated to explain.</p>
<p>Who goes on dates to talk about what they do for a living, anyway? At that point you know your date sucks, and it’s turning into a therapy session, or you are getting past the 3m limit and into each other’s business.</p>
<p>Ask the right questions about what he does, or if he works in so and so district, and you get an idea of the income or whatever…talk about funny giddy stuff that leads to getting you laid 🙂</p>

<p>Moving in creates a lot of headaches, unless you’re going to have kids it really doesn’t make sense. </p>
<p>That said if you’re looking to end that type of relationship it would be better to find a way to end it on amicable terms. IE: help her get situated with a new living arrangement etc assuming she doesn’t hate your guts.</p>
<p>Generally a relationship going past the 3-6 month mark is getting into serious territory to better off to break it off at the fling mark (ie 3 months or so, or one season).</p>
<p>As soon as you pass 9 months you’re definitely in a serious long term relationship.</p>

But that was exactly why I did it. I wanted to experience “married life” without severely risking my finances. Now I can honestly say been there, done that and definitely not for me.</p>

<p>Guys you need to check yourself on seafood. Heard about Fukushima, the ocean is filling up with radioactive goo. Plus mercury in top predators. Plus tons of other pollution. Mercury will fuck you up for life and it bioaccumulates over the course of your life. Finding “clean” untainted sea-food could be a full-time job…unless you are rich enough to outsource this to a PA I would suggest steering clear. Much love.</p>

hilarious but very thoughtful adivces. Thank you.<br/>
Most guys i meet are either 1) from work; 2) from business school (im doing a part-time masters in finance degree). So ultimately they know the industry/company i work in 🙁<br/>

2. girls with successful careers are high maintenance – avoid this<br/>
3. agree with not dating short haired girls – typically think of themselves as ‘serious’. date girls that have long hair only.<br/>
4. only child – this is a red flag. way to high maintenance</p>
<p>learn from my mistakes haha.. also agree on the family point. Will think about this more in future. </p>
<p>I think having one serious relationship in your life is good. Because when you break up, your tolerance levels fall significantly. This teaches you not to put too much effort into relationships because they end up wasting your time in the long run. And distracting what you should be focusing on – networking, work and doing things you want to do.</p>

<p>Do you guys ever “emotionally invest” in any relationship with any girl? </p>
<p>How do you do this effectively? Find myself always feeling too much when I know I shouldn’t.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. The key is to remain “emotionally distant”.</p>
<p>Otherwise you will make stupid decisions and over time she will lose attraction for you if she knows you’re more invested than her. No point at all.</p>
