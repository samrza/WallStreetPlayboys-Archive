</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><div class="featured-image"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190909041700/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/get-rid-of-jealousy-hatred-and-stress-by-thinking-in-multiple-dimensions/"><img alt="Get Rid of Jealousy, Hatred and Stress by Thinking in Multiple Dimensions" class="entry-image" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20190909041700im_/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/download-1-e1524540467723-150x93.jpg"/></a></div><p class="p1">One thing we have realized over the years is that the vast majority of the population (<strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190909041700/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/what-is-a-regular-person/">see regular people</a></strong>) think one-dimensionally. We had a joke tweet stating there is no such thing as a successful person with an unattractive wife. Immediately, we got low quality responses citing “Mark Zuckerberg” as a counter example. This of course proved our point. They admit that she is not attractive but then say he is a good example. This of course defeats the entire argument. Why? How can you view someone as successful if you’d never choose his life partner? As we said, one dimensional. To prevent one-dimensional thinking we’ll provide several ways to decrease any form of jealousy/resentment in the future. Once we think about life in multiple dimensions you’ll also pick up on the “sub-conscious” mind of your peers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Thinking in Multiple Dimensions</strong></p>
<p><b>Multi-Dimensions Gets Rid of Jealousy: </b>Most people have jealousy/resentment but never look at the whole picture. If you take a single person, using Zuckerberg again, people will envy his life. We on the other hand have absolutely no interest in ever being him. No. This is not a “hater” post since he is living his own life. If he got to billions of dollars and wants to continue down his current path. good on him. It’s not for us. Jealousy gets erased once you look at life multi-dimension-ally. If you look at a single dimension we can guarantee you’ll find someone who is superior to you in at least one aspect of life after meeting less than five people. Instead, ask yourself <em>“would i really want to take everything the person has?”</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">A good way to see if people understand this topic is to see if they would trade places with Warren Buffet. Mark Zuckerberg is a harder example since most people cannot comprehend being unable to change his personal life (remember when you trade you also take their personality and future life choices). If we use Warren Buffet we can see if the person gets the picture. No one reading this (unless there is someone in their 80s reading this) would ever considering trading their lives for his. Sure he has billions upon billions of dollars. But. He is 80+ after all. Would you trade places with Buffet? No. You’re going to be gone in short order.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Multi-Dimensions Create Role Models: </b>Now lets say you do find someone you would trade with. As a basic example lets create an imaginary guy exactly the same age as you with more money, better fitness, better looking girlfriends, low stress levels and a fun personality. Instead of being jealous, what is the natural reaction? Befriend the person. In our souls we know that the people we spend time with end up being similar to ourselves. This is why attractive people generally hang out with attractive people. Fit people generally have fit friends… so on and so forth. By looking at things multi-dimension-ally you’ll weed out your frequent contact list extremely quickly. The people on the list should have a similar value chain as you. Otherwise you’re surrounding yourself with people you don’t want to become.</p>
<p class="p1">Taking a step back, we find that this makes it <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">impossible to be jealous of other people</span></em>. In just four paragraphs we have eradicated all forms of jealousy. If you find yourself being jealous of someone then we suggest looking at it multi-dimension-ally first. Just because someone is good at Item A doesn’t mean they are any good at the rest (basic herd mentality automatically assumes an expert in Topic A is an expert in Topic B… Even if unrelated – Lord knows we would never ask a 100lbs overweight billionaire for fitness advice). The second step is to then ask why you’re jealous. If someone really has a life you want, then you should actively find ways to spend more *free* time with them. After all, they have what you want and you’re willingly admitting it. Hating on them isn’t going to help!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Multi-Dimensions Allows for Diversification: </b>Now that we’ve gotten rid of all jealousy, it is also time to kill the hating part as well! On a personal note we don’t hate anyone. Seriously, we don’t. If we don’t enjoy someone’s company, we go dead silent and simply ignore. Hating the person just gives them more attention and burns valuable time. This simple point will save hours of time. When you dislike someone, remember that the easiest way to get them out of your life is by ignoring them. It really is that simple. Then if you run into them in the future, since you haven’t had to waste your time with them for the past year or so, you’ll be able to put up with the short interaction.</p>
<p class="p1">Now comes the fun part. While we want to completely ignore people we don’t jive with, we can use the multi-dimensional strategy to help us choose “leaders”. Leader is just a cheesy word for someone better than another person at a certain task. As a basic example when you think about sports, you automatically assume the best player on the team needs to be the “leader”. Lets apply the same logic to parts of your life. If you want to get in shape, you should find someone with a physique that you’re working towards. If the guy is not bright and can’t do much else but work out… that’s fine! Just make sure you follow his ideas on working out. Similarly, if a guy is making 4x what you’re making per year, that is also fantastic. If he has an overbearing wife that you’d never talk to in a million years… Just don’t bring it up. Follow that money making advice and use it to your personal advantage.</p>
<p class="p1">Before moving on we have a critical note to write here. <span class="s1"><b><i>Under no circumstances do you offer help to the person you’re taking advice from.</i></b></span> This is counter intuitive but works much better. Most people have the logical assumption of “well he is not good with women so i should help him there”. Absolutely not. People have large egos. If a guy is better at making money than you are <span class="s1"><b>and</b></span> you’re asking him for advice… He will never listen to your dating tips. This is because he already thinks he is better than you at everything. This doesn’t make logical sense since it should be clear based on your lifestyles but it is reality. <span class="s1"><b><i>People are extremely invested into their egos so never give advice unless asked.</i></b></span> This is a serious warning and if this rule is broken don’t be surprised if that workout partner/business partner etc suddenly drops off the face of the planet.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Multi-Dimensions Help With “Life Math”:</b> Life math is nothing more than deciding where you want to be in 5, 10, 15 years or so. There is no way to plan 10 years perfectly. But. You can take a framework and use it to decide where you need to be. As a simple example, maybe you’re interested in having a family. Maybe you want to be single forever. Maybe you only want to work 20 hours a week. Maybe you want to party hard for a few years. Maybe you want to a take year off to travel the world. So on and so forth.</p>
<p class="p1">Multi-dimensional looks are extremely valuable with the internet. Now that you have no hatred and no jealousy after reading this post, you can look forward to the future. Find someone who is 10 years older than you and is currently living a life you want to live. Seriously. They do exist and it is possible to meet them. Most are just too lazy to look. Once you find them you can then map out a rough idea of how they got there, what went wrong and what they would do differently. A simple example is “quitting work”. Many years ago we used to believe in “retirement” where you hit your number at age 35-40 and simply did nothing forever. <span class="s1"><i>We were dead wrong there</i></span>. Every single person we met that was over the age of 40 and “retired” said the same thing. You’ll get tired of drinking and partying within 3 months. They were right. This simple adjustment changes the way you map out where you want to be from where you currently sit today.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at an example. If you find a guy you admire that is 10 years older than you (meaning you’d love to be in their shoes in 10 years), ask them what they would do differently. This can range from money to life experiences. If you’re already on the path financially maybe it ends up being related to travel. We have no doubt they will have several recommendations for you. It is not possible to go through life and live for 10 years straight with no mistakes. Mistakes are always made, you just need to find the right person to admit to a few of them.</p>
<p class="p1">For fun, the most common one we hear from people these days is “fitness”. Most older people let themselves go in the 30-40 age range and it becomes increasingly difficult to “get it back”. With this in mind, have a good idea of how your health regimen will evolve as you age and your metabolism slows down. To cap this all off, one guy had an interesting one which was the following: “I wish I upgraded my gym and took Yoga earlier”. Why? He now meets all of his current girlfriends at the gym/yoga studios after battling some muscle tension for years (two birds one stone, double entendre).</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Multi-Dimensions Give You Flexibility: </b>As mentioned above, 5-year and 10-year plans rarely go accordingly for every single thing a person is trying to achieve. Going from $0 in the bank to 1) a million dollars, 2) great social circle, 3) tip top fitness and 4) freedom to travel takes a good amount of time (we estimate 10 years as achievable). The good news is that you can make adjustments. Generally speaking, when you’re looking to pad your net-worth… freedom or fitness typically take a hit. When someone tries to increase their social skills, this usually hurts the fitness line the most. If someone tries to increase fitness, their social life takes a slight step back. So on and so forth. So if you end up getting to year five and miss slightly on two of the “big four” don’t sweat it, the multi-dimensional outlook gives you a better holistic view on how you’ve progressed.</p>
<p class="p1">For what it is worth we have found that the last item is actually the hardest of the four. While money gets the lime light, it is actually freedom that is much more rare. In fact, many people with money are not free at all. They could make half a million dollars a year and not save much if they have kids to feed and live in an expensive city (yes it is possible, just look at the rents and add in three more people to support!).</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Dimensions Make it Difficult to Trade Places: </strong>Putting the Multi-dimensional pieces together, the key item here is remembering that you must live with that person’s choices. All of them. This is hard to do mentally since your average person only sees the surface. If someone decides to trade places with Warren Buffet then they also get to live for ~10 years. Similarly, if someone idolizes a guy worth $100M+ that is out of shape and lives a personal life that is in shambles… He too gets to live with all of those decisions with no ability to change them (you’re forced to make all the decisions that person would make). Once we can put this lens on you’ll find that there are maybe 0.01% of people you’re interested in trading places with. These people are guys you look up to. So you wouldn’t dislike them in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Amazing Long-term Benefits of Multiple Dimensions</b></p>
<p>Before listing all of them there is one downside. People will attempt to “bring you down” by comparing you on a single item every single time they run into you. This is how passive aggressive people work since they’ve only beaten <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190909041700/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/the-five-rigged-games-in-life/">one of the five rigged games in life</a>.</strong> Get used to it. The options are the same: 1) smile, nod and agree and 2) put them in their place by amplifying. As many of you know we prefer the first option since it kills the conversation. The amplification part makes people feel much more uncomfortable because only a secure person would admit another man/woman is better than them in a specific task. Try both, they both work. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pro-Tip:</span></em><em> </em><em>extremely insecure and passive aggressive people will usually try to put you in the one situation in which you would lose to them over and over again. If they have horrible social skills and are old they will do their best to put you into a room with old people to call you an “entitled young guy”. If they are good at science then they would attempt to compare you to them in that topic only. It is the only thing they have so they have to highlight it to feel better about themselves. </em></p>
<p><strong>Easier to Plan: </strong>Multiple dimensions allow you to plan a lot better. If you’re focused on a single piece of life you’ll likely go down the wrong path. Besides, who wants to be a deca-millionaire with type II diabetes? Who wants to have fame and money but live less than thirty years? Who wants to date beautiful women only to lose it all and live like a bum smoking marijuana at age thirty five? So on and so forth. Multiple dimensions help you find real people you look up to. We’re not going to tell anyone how to live, if you’ve found this blog you’re likely in agreement with some of the points but not all of them. The key here is making sure you develop the correct well rounded personality that you always wanted. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In short, success is defined by what you want not what you’re told to want.</span></em> We have an ingrained belief of what success is and yet we’d unlikely want any of it (not interested in fame, not interested in a house in suburbia and most certainly not interested in “settling down” at the standard age of 30).</p>
<p><strong>Easier to Walk Away: </strong>There is no reason to keep in contact with the same people for a long period of time just because there is “history” there. The reason why many successful people have friends for over 10 years is they are quick to identify people on the same path. The path to success in their eyes. While a few will likely make it with you, the vast majority will come and go. It isn’t even a big deal. If someone does extremely well and moves onto bigger and better things, shake their hand and say good luck! If you don’t burn their time, they will happily help you in the future anyway. Just don’t be a burden on people who make a leap. The same applies backward. If you make a big leap, as long as no one is sucking up your time, you should be happy to respond. While “walk away” has a negative connotation, you could also replace this with “pruning” a rose garden. In order to make sure you have high quality you have to maintain the rose garden. If one of the “buds” spring up and have improved dramatically, you let it grow and it’s back into the garden.</p>
<p><strong>Significant Emotional Control: </strong>You will see a 100% improvement in emotional control if these items are taken seriously. Why? If it becomes difficult to be jealous or hateful towards someone… why would you be emotionally rattled? You wouldn’t be! Emotional control is a fascinating topic because a lot of people confuse introversion with emotional control. Just because someone doesn’t act out verbally, they will act out in terms of body language and behavior. Emotional control is your ability to remain in the same state despite the surroundings. This is why we put so much more value into “clutch” players in sports and into “calm take downs” in an argument. In fact these things are so valued by simply talking slowly and calmly you can be more convincing even if you’re incorrect (important negotiation tip there).</p>
<p><strong>Easier to Improve! </strong>That is right. Since your view of life will be less one dimensional, you can improve your life quickly. If you only focus on one item it is unlikely that you’ll see significant strides in a few months. It could be fitness, social life, money, etc. Enter any topic and if you only have one item you’re interested in it is much more likely that you’ll hit the “wall”. Each wall will take a longer amount of time to break down so it is best to see improvements in other areas of life beyond this. We can’t even count how many people focus on single course of action and end up losing it all. Focusing on money is probably the most common where chasing an extra $1M when you’re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190909041700/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/how-much-is-your-time-worth/">already worth $10M</a> defeats the purpose of money in the first place.

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Interesting and agree with everything except this (don’t agree or disagree – just wondering what exactly it means) </p>
<p>“If you only focus on one item it is unlikely that you’ll see significant strides in a few months. It could be fitness, social life, money, etc. Enter any topic and if you only have one item you’re interested in it is much more likely that you’ll hit the “wall”</p>
<p>So someone in their 20s shouldn’t spend 90% of their time on money if they aren’t at 7 figures yet? Hard to grasp why if you focus on just money you *wont* improve there. </p>
<p>Regardless, love the post!</p>

<p>Quick follow up on this, great article (as usual!).</p>
<p>“People are extremely invested into their egos” can be an article of its own.</p>
<p>You notice this when dealing with all sort of people. The difference I’ve noticed is that high earners/entrepreneurs don’t let their ego get in the way of rational thinking (i.e doubling down on a loser since that would require admitting they’re wrong) while the reg’s egos are very fragile they’ll do anything to protect it.</p>
<p>Just an observation, but I ask myself “how does this person’s ego play a role in this?” when trying to analyze someone’s motives behind something.</p>

<p>Thanks for the post, guys, Knew it would be a good one the moment I read that there is no reason to have envy for jealousy! </p>
<p>Regarding the Multi-Dimensions Give You Flexibility section, you say: “if you end up getting to year five and miss slightly on two of the “big four” don’t sweat it, the multi-dimensional outlook gives you a better holistic view on how you’ve progressed.</p>
<p>So, if you’re killing it in say, social circle and freedom/travel, but not money and fitness, how do you determine which of the “big 4” to pivot to, especially 5 years out? Can you really compare them apples to apples? Your previous philosophy always seemed to be health&gt;money&gt;relationships&gt; ,with travel/freedom thrown somewhere in the mix, but in this post don’t there isn’t any differentiation. </p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>

<p>I’ve found that asking questions of regular people, having them talk tall of themselves to inflate their egos will actually see them coming back for more, almost as if they’re in a therapy session or something. </p>
<p>Not there yet, but when I eventually will deal with important business people, this is a tactic that I’ll use. </p>
<p>Being in my early thirties it now amazes me how little people think ahead in their lives. It’s usually the TGIF (Thank God It’s Friday) and soon it’s summer vacation mentality that occupies their minds. </p>
<p>Not how they can improve their own health by exercising daily or eating healthy. I follow your program outlined in Efficiency and it’s done wonders for me, as well as cutting back on unhealthy foods. Most people look forward to “cake day” or “happy hour” or whatever. </p>
<p>Despite being in a horrendous state at the moment, I’ve actually managed to earn some $$ by investing time and energy in building a side business. It’s ridiculously easy to do so today. </p>
<p>I literally live close to the forest in a remote spot in rural Norway surrounded by hillbillies and rednecks. Despite this, I’m able to generate side income using the Internet. While regular people are looking to clip coupons and rant about their job, I try to sell something. It amazes me, yet again, why so few people would rather spend $4000 on useless materialistic stuff instead of buying online courses created my millionaires. </p>
<p>Thanks for the golden nuggets and please keep’em coming.</p>

<p>Haha, great post, I was never sure whether I was smart or lazy, as I always thought other people suck at most things and are – in rare instances – only at most one thing proficient. Currently erring towards the lazy-judgment, as shit needs to get done, but as soon as shit is done back to the smart-judgement, for it is a much more sane attitude to make decisions on that basis.</p>
<p>As I crossed over to an intermediate level in strength training and it takes months going from lighter training to harder training by means of block periodization, I found it also works well to periodize other efforts, putting intentionally more effort into social life a few weeks and less into other endeavours, then slowly sliding the scale towards other goals. Currently figuring out how to maximize phase potentiation (e.g. found that during busy and stressful times bodybuilding type of training is just not heavy enough).</p>

<p>Very strong closing.</p>
<p>As WSPs said, when asking for advice, you might think that you can offer something in return for reciprocation.</p>
<p>No. They gave you advice, you make them feel superior to you. That’s the deal. I make this mistake once per year, trying to eliminate it.</p>

<p>A key thing is to not get deficient in any area. If you’re deficient (sub average) I feel it’s good to spend more time and effort in that area. </p>
<p>Assuming health and basic social life is not deficient. If you’re not financially independent, money should be priority since it gives you travel freedom and lower stress once you are rich. </p>
<p>That’s my thought, don’t get deficient in the major categories. After that it’s up to the person. Some guys are motivated to be billionaires. Some just want blow and hoes. </p>
<p>Also. I’m surprised you guys haven’t mentioned just hire a personal trainer once you’re rich. Easy way to stay fit. Forced exercise regimen.</p>

<p>“Enter any topic and if you only have one item you’re interested in it is much more likely that you’ll hit the “wall”.”</p>
<p>just wanted to add that besides the 5 areas, this concept has proven very true in the case of hobbies/talents/skills for me.</p>
<p>Take for example making videos (something I’ve picked up lately with my limited spare time). As a basic example to get a video out you’ll need good camerawork, video editing skills, and on-screen content. </p>
<p>i’ve been able to break the video-editing skills wall down rather quickly because learning it is a series of concrete technical concepts, but creating ideas for screen content has been difficult since I haven’t mastered creativity yet. </p>
<p>having multiple focuses towards an end goal makes me feel like I’m progressing even if I occasionally stagnate in some of the areas</p>

<p>Hahahah this is awesome!!!!</p>
<p>So true. Especially about the passive aggressive behavior. </p>
<p>I’ve found the most passive aggressive people are the 30-50 year old CUCKS’s that simply chose wrong (ego-driven non-scalable income —&gt; “VP”s who only make $100K a yr, doctors, lawyers, professors i.e. broke people) in life hahaha. </p>
<p>Regrettably, traded their entire life for pennies. Still working 100 hours a week and making significantly less than a 26 year old guy who saw the game for what it is (tip of the cap to you, wallstreetplayboys) dropped straight out of an ivy school (one they couldn’t even get in to [even worse they actually think that this matters – i.e. why they are broke when anyone could realize that wealth is correlated to your ability to produce recurring scalable income thru time by providing a great product to your customers &amp; not what college you go to]) and dedicated every waking moment of his life for 10,000 hours straight to produce scalable income by building a company right off the bat. Failing his way to success. </p>
<p>Guys that will take any opportunity to “put” him in his place by asking meaningless corporate questions (“So tell me your innovation process? What lean methodology do you use to guide innovation? What corporate values does your company have? What leadership values do you have? … the fuck bro? its called cash mother fucking flow!!! CASH IS KINGGGGG hahaha my leadership value is to stuff as much fucking cash as I can into my pockets by building a great company! )</p>
<p>I rather hang out with people in poverty as they realize that life is transient &amp; are shrewd enough to just milk the federal system (disability income, etc.) ego-lessly &amp; are happier drinking on a stoop all day than these cucks described above. </p>
<p>Guys who don’t even fuck their wives anymore. Too scared to ask to get their dick sucked. To scared to get divorced because they are overweight &amp; failed to take care of their most precious asset – their health. Married a soft 6 when she was at her highest price (27 years old – after she racked up 3X more notches on her belt slutting around from 22-26). Needless to say her true value was revealed right after the first kid when she called it a day &amp; became a fat fuck. </p>
<p>Oh btw, that is a big reason why they are broke. Don’t even know the difference between price &amp; value. Talk about “investing in stocks” or “trading stocks” yet can’t even describe how they would come to value the stock they are considering buying. Just spewing out the fucking horseshit they read on consensus websites like marketwatch.com or yahoo finance. Textbook consensus people that buy high &amp; sell low. </p>
<p>[Yes I realize that in reality they are trying the best they can in life &amp; cannot face the truth that they chose wrong. Quite sad actually. That I was just lucky &amp; they weren’t. Probably would have been that person. But hey – its fun to be vain sometimes. Grateful for life. Live it up boys!!!!]</p>

<p>Yes I like this comment and agree with most of it. And this is coming from someone who attended an Ivy (yes the most prestigious one. no didn’t drop out lol). </p>
<p>One little thing about cash flow and “my only process is putting more cash into my pockets building companies”..I’d guess this business was ecommerce to consumers. Unlikely B2B. </p>
<p>These sort of “brands” and “online businesses” are great particuarly because they cater to younger guys (tech saavy, more mentally agile, less “burdened” by so called proper ways of doing business). </p>
<p>What’s harder? Building a company like Vulcan materials with aggregate and mining pits eveyrwhere, a more complicated cap structure, countless different government/zoning laws/market factors to consider…or an “ecommerce company” with maybe 4 lines on the balance sheet and less on the income statement &amp; cash flow!!! lol</p>
<p>But more power to ya. Stack that dough and make ’em cucks mad!</p>

<p>I think it’s because they thought money would solve their problems and when they got it they did not use it “efficiently” or effectively as they could have so they get jealous of those without money but have amazing male and female relationships, an exciting lifestyle and a upbeat attitude. They should just mimick the bets qualities of those people they are jealous of and use money to accelerate that process.</p>

<p>For once I disagree, I, being in my mid twenties would change places with Buffet. Lets give him 5 years of solid life yet, if you liquidated his holdings even with the massive tax hits you could single handily change or positively influence the lives of millions of people around the globe almost guaranteed. It would be hard to replicate this result even given my young age. Granted this ideology completely removes any ego from the equation.</p>

<p>Huge post for me here as I am struggling with this but in a different way, I am more envious of the past and am looking for something to look up to right now in my life.</p>
<p>I had a shitty college experience and envy the guys who got good grades, were in great frats, dated hot girls due to frat status, got nice campus jobs (bartender) and had a great college experience overall. Then after graduation they broke into the nice finance or real estate jobs.</p>
<p>My envy is more due to the fact that now I will never have anything close to that in life because life after college is different. I just haven’t found the guy after college who I would envy nearly as much as I envied the frat guys in college.</p>
<p>I mean even the guys with a nice job and pretty girlfriend I do not envy all that much knowing that they aren’t sleeping around, getting laid or partying.</p>
<p>It has been one massive mental setback for me and quite frankly, Dan Bilzerian’s Instagram may be the only thing giving me even a hope for life because I have not found what a stellar life after college looks like.</p>
<p>Even if you could earn it, everyone around your age would be married with kids so all the high quality people (hot girls and cool guys) would be gone. It has been impacting me for over a year now.</p>

<p>I’m honestly amazed by how much money can do your social life in the real world. </p>
<p>I’ve posted my income here before and that I’m 10 months into my first job. I’ve found that because I can afford more expensive things (travel, central apt, clothes) possibilities just open up. And there’s less competition, everywhere. It’s like the opposite of college where social status was the real currency. I’m actually getting tired of my people telling me they can’t do X or Y. I definitely have a long way to go when it comes to my annual income. I can definitely earn more if I can position myself into a high-paying niche. That said, the head start has been really valuable and I’m glad that I can see the benefits even at this early stage.</p>

<p>Which path would be better to pursue? </p>
<p>Computer Science Degree and become a Software Developer eventually build my own Product</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Become a Residential Real Estate Agent then broker and ultimately create my own Real Estate Brand/franchise</p>
<p>I’m not super interested in coding algorithms and placed average on my SAT. If the Comp Sci is the way of the future I can suck it up and become proficient at coding etc.</p>

<p>But I think there could be a value in learning the various tools and having them at your disposal. Because most value-add these days is, and most likely will be, in the form of technology. So even if you can’t build the most scalable web app ever, you can understand how/why this will solve a problem. After spending a year reading hackernews, I’m able to know what general tech solutions are out there for most types of problems.<br/>
ex. general method of setting up microcontroller system network for automating physical processes, capturing the valuable data, etc.<br/>
ex. starting in real estate, writing a script in a day that automates a business contact’s workflow, saving him time. maybe he pays you, lets you in on deal, tells you about a property, etc.</p>
<p>What do you think? Most normal guys don’t even want to be code monkeys for more than a few years in their 20’s, they move to management.</p>

<p>Have you tried doing either? You have a laptop to view this site you can write whatever code you want on it. You can rent a cluster of AWS 16 core machines pre-installed with Hadoop, Spark, and SQL with like 4 commands from your terminal. </p>
<p>As a test, see if you can build the standard checklist web app (user accounts, CRUD lists/items, basic UI). This is a standard test for one of the top freelance coding agencies so if you pass try doing something harder.</p>
