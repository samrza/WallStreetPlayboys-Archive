Unfortunately? There is no value in a post like that. Anyone who has succeeded is not going to be interested in a post on rules since they already have their life together. Generally, this question is posed by people who are in their mid 20s and are looking for guidelines for the future. With that in mind, this post is going to cover general beliefs and steer away from rules. By the time you’re in your 30s you shouldn’t be worried about money, girls or friends. But. We’ll go ahead and add on to these themes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Financial</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Never Trading Time for Money: </b>Maybe you had to take a few salary jobs earlier in life (20-23) to break into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190717122342/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-choosing-a-career/">a real career</a> (usually engineers fall in this bucket). That is fine. But. By the time you are in your thirties under zero circumstances should you ever work for an hourly wage ever again. You will work for performance (sales/revenue generation), ownership (equity) or you won’t work at all. Period. You’re going to leverage *other* people’s time and never take on any sort of hourly consulting role. It just doesn’t give a good ROI. Finally, if you’re working in a career, yes part of your compensation will be a salary. But. It will not be more than ~50% of your total income anymore. Otherwise? You’re going ot be fired anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Millionaire or Something Went Wrong: </strong>We have a clear path to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190717122342/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/1-million-10-years-zero-excuses/">a million dollars laid out</a>. Since this is a post on your 30s there is literally no exception to *not* being a millionaire and in your mid 30s. You would have to make terrible decisions in life over and over again to miss this financial hurdle. Even if you didn’t move up the totem pole quickly, if you’re making ~$150-200K a year it is quite easy to get to $1M. The reality? Most people reading this blog (Wall Street focused people) will clear $1M in net worth by the time they are 30.</p>
<p><strong>Three Forms of Income: </strong>Most people who reach 7 figures in net worth have closer to 5 solid sources of income. You should have at least 3 sources of income. If one of your legs gets taken out (business goes south, career goes south or investments go south) you should be perfectly fine. With three forms of income, if the economy collapses you won’t sweat it. You will simply lose one, maybe two, forms of income and get back on your feet to focus on what matters (getting new forms of income again). More importantly? Your total income should easily be north of $250K (more likely $400K+ at least).</p>
<p><strong>Easy Referral Money: </strong>You should have several friends who do good work. Lawyers, accountants, online marketers etc. You should receive a referral fee if you find someone who will benefit from their services. If you are going to recommend something you may as well take the fee as well (no point in giving your time away for free). A better example is a recent referral for a top tier accountant. Once your friends start making $300K+ off of their businesses, they are going to focus on limiting tax liabilities. A good accountant can save $4-5K easily on a $300K income stream. Once you refer your friend, the accountant will happily pay you for the referral. Your friend is happy you’re making money off of the referral and your accountant is going to keep you as a customer for a long time (he probably won’t even charge you if you refer 5+ low maintenance customers). In short? Don’t do anything for free. There is no point in wasting your valuable time.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Tolerance: </strong>We get a lot of questions about managing finances. Unfortunately? We will never under any circumstances work with retail investors. It is not worth the time, money or hassle. If you do not know your own risk tolerance, the last place you should go to for information is the Internet. Go and talk to a professional (for free!). It took us a long time to find a useful source and we’re glad we no longer have to field personal finance questions anymore!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Social Life</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Longer Go Out of Your Way: </strong>Maybe you didn’t have fantastic social skills as a younger guy. So you spent some of your time going out of your way to be social. Blocking out time to meet girls at clubs/bars or even trying your hand at meeting girls in SoHo. Fantastic. By the time you are 30? This should end. Your time should be extremely valuable. You simply meet girls on your way to work, meetings or even at the airport. Maybe you enjoy nightlife and go out with your friends. But. Under no circumstances do you block out time to “do approaches” since this is an enormous time suck. If your “opportunity cost” is $500 an hour. That 4 hour hangover the next day simply isn’t worth it. Finally, if you’re one of of those rare people who can go out 5 nights a week and see no impact… Well then it doesn’t matter. The main point? Don’t let your social life impact more important things: Health, Money, current friendships. No strange girl on the street or at the club is worth it. No exceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tougher to Meet Friends: </strong>On television they teach you that successful people have hundreds of thousands of elite friends who they hang out with all of the time. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Successful people have a lot of soft touch friendships. By the time you’re in your 30s you will have ~10-15 solid contacts who probably live in different cities. You have maybe 2-3 solid friends in your city that you see 1x a month and another 12 friends who live in other major cities. The rest? They are all acquaintances. Acquaintances are fantastic for grabbing a drink and “hanging out”. But. Under no circumstances do you ever tell them how much money you really make (or have) or any real details about your personal life. They will try to tear you down.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A Solid Niche: </strong>Similar to never going out of your way to meet new people, you’ve already developed a niche. It does not matter what the niche is. Maybe you have a few high end lounges you enjoy going to (everyone knows your name) or maybe you have a social circle involving museums and art. Neither is right or wrong. The real point? You’ve combined an actual interest of yours with a way to meet new people (new social circles) or girls to date.</p>
<p><strong>You Shouldn’t Be Married: </strong>As soon as you hit 30, the “marathon of life” works in your favor. The competition starts to drop like flies. Men are getting married left right and center and you’ll get tons of invitations to another lame “international wedding destination”. Attrition is really weeding out the competition. Perhaps, 5-10 years ago you could make the case that men didn’t “know better” when it comes to marriage. In 2015? This is simply a terrible BS excuse. The only downside? You’ll lose a lot of friends and acquaintances during this time period.</p>
<p><strong>International Friends: </strong>At this point you should have contacts abroad. At least 5 of them. You should be able to land in a few countries, call/text a friend and have no problem meeting sometime during the week. This will make your life a lot more interesting. Since the pendulum swings both ways, you can show them the ins and outs of the United States of America (best place on the planet). Eventually, you’ll notice key mannerisms of specific countries  (the colors they wear to the brand names they like), which will make it even easier for you to spot foreigners out in NYC.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Obtaining Information</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Anecdotal Evidence is the Best Evidence: </strong>If someone disagrees with this, they are likely unsuccessful. Why? The only way to gain an edge is to have a strategy that no one else is doing. If it is well documented, researched and public… Then everyone else is doing it as well. How in the world is that going to give you an edge? It won’t. In fact, new age dating advice cannot be proven (yet) and anyone who has gone out more than 100+ times can easily tell you it works.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The best way to obtain more anecdotal evidence? Cross check your beliefs with other people living a similar aggressive lifestyle. If you know that Person A, B and C all have the same goals as you and they are all taking action… Have a quick conversation to exchange notes on what seems to work and what doesn’t. This applies to everything from lifting weights to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190717122342/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/money-making-machine/">making money</a> to meeting new people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Action Over Books: </strong>While you should certainly read every single day (maybe 30 minutes to an hour) you should understand that *action* will result in much more progress than information. You can read a million books on how to shoot a jump shot. But… the chances you shoot anywhere near close to Stephen Curry is zero percent if you don’t actually shoot a basketball. A guy with less than perfect form who shoots 1 million shots will beat a guy who shoots 100 shots but studied basketball for 20 hours a day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Action applies to making money and generating revenue as well. You’re much better off trying to buy traffic. You’re much better off picking up the phone and trying to sell. You’re much better off cold emailing. The key is to spend &lt;10% of your time doing research (preventing bone headed mistakes) and using 90%+ of your time taking action where you’ll make minor fixable errors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Selective Information: </strong>We had to put <em>*action over books*</em> as the best information because life experience always wins. That said, in order to find good information you should have a strong filter before even considering the content, here is ours: 1) is this person better than you at the task? If not… don’t bother reading or building a relationship anymore, 2) is this going to provide information or emotion… the latter is useless but feels like good content to average people, 3) is the information based on studies or years of mistakes? Choose the person who has made many mistakes, 4) is the book worth reading after the first 50 pages? If not… Throw it in the garbage and 5) can you apply the new information within the next 3 months? If not… select a new book.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The real trick here? You’re only going to find ~10 books a year that are worth reading by the time you’re in your 30s. Assuming you’re successful, there are very few resources that are going to improve your life and unless you’re reading for fun (fiction, not action) you’re not going to read all that much. In fact? You’re probably better off learning a new language or picking up a new hobby instead of reading books that aren’t going to help you anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Time Management<br/>
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>30-55 hours a Week: </strong>By the time you’re a millionaire and don’t work on an hourly basis, you should be able to make your own schedule. Naturally, you’re going to get bored easily since you put in the hard work (60+ hours a week for ~6-10 years) so you’ll probably work 45-50 hours a week anyway. That said, you should have a team working with you so you can skip days when there is no need to work hard. If you recently closed a transaction that exceeds your quota for the year… there is no reason to show up to work on Fridays for the next 3 weeks anyway. Have everyone else send the basic updates for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Learn to Delegate: </strong>This was an easy lead in from paragraph one. If you are not trading your time for money? You should become more efficient by delegating tasks to other people. Any task that is not going to lead to more income but *needs to be done* should be delegated. This means updating documents, making tweaks to sales pages, dealing with technology updates, answering unimportant requests to show you’re “always available”. All of these tasks are not worth your valuable time. Hire someone to do them for you and pay them slightly above market rates so they have no reason to complain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>No More Chores: </strong>Unless you enjoy doing chores for fun (cooking as an example)… there is no reason to do them anymore. Make a list of items that take away from your time on a weekly basis. Remove at least three of them so you don’t have to bother anymore. This won’t cost you much. Maybe $300-500 a month and will allow you to focus on more important things: 1) your health, 2) thinking of ways to generate more income and 3) how to diversify your income streams. A quick list of things you shouldn’t waste time with: 1) dry cleaning, 2) shopping, 3) responding to emails from low-end clients, 4) team building activities – ask someone on your team to attend and be the cheerleader, 5) cooking and 6) booking flights/hotels/etc.</p>

<p>Hahaha! There was another guy who said something similar about being 6′ good looking and rich thinking “why in the world is this girl turning me down she’s dumb”. That’s when you know you’ve made it.</p>
<p>Our blog became popular with the wrong group of people, so we had to kick them all out at the expense of traffic for a month. 100% worth it. If they come back we will go to more extreme measures.</p>

<p>I’m actually really broke… However I’m only 22 years old.</p>
<p>According to this post I’m well on my way. </p>
<p>I was at a strip club and asked a REALLY HOT stripper. Like an 11. </p>
<p>“Money or love?”. </p>
<p>“Money”</p>

<p>“Most people who reach 7 figures in net worth have closer to 5 solid sources of income. You should have at least 3 sources of income. If one of your legs gets taken out (business goes south, career goes south or investments go south) you should be perfectly fine.”</p>
<p>When you refer to 5 forms of income, I get career, business, and investments. What are the additional ones? Are you referring to having more than one business, or something else?</p>

<p>You guys have mentioned this technique many times and it should have appeared again here: “smile, nod, agree”  (ignore).</p>
<p>When you’re in your 30s you start to give up on people who simply don’t get it. You don’t waste time arguing back and forth because you already know they are fooling themselves and don’t understand. Instead of bickering and arguing you need to make them feel good so they like you and don’t bother you anymore.</p>
<p>Another one stolen from your twitter: if you get into an argument with a fool you are the fool. </p>
<p>This is how it is when you get older. Better to just let them make their own mistakes and avoid interjecting with what you actually think, since they won’t listen anyway. Smile, nod, agree. Let it go. Also glad to see you guys are starting to ban and block people, the traffic here must be decent so no need to read low value comments anymore, give them the boot!</p>

<p>Another one to add is to ask less. As mentioned at the top of this post, most people already have their ideas carved out so they ask a lot less questions. Instead you try to find reasons to add or subtract some one from your circle of friends. Makes life a lot easier!!!</p>

<p>New information always starts as anecdotal until it can be proven. Once it is proven it loses its value because everyone already knows the “trick”.</p>
<p>So you really want to arm yourself with what people will know “later” so you have an edge now.</p>
<p>This is why reading tons of stale research is not worth reading at all. It won’t be anything that will give you an edge (today). </p>
<p>Research is primarily used for avoiding huge mistakes. But if you’re successful and 30 something… You already avoided those mistakes.</p>

<p>The reason for anecdotal evidence over research (besides what was mentioned), is that a person who has an understanding of WHY something might work and can thus properly hypothesize and REASON out the meaning behind the anecdote will do exactly that while explaining it. That’s because that’s how their mental process is working, it’s far more useful to figure out why it worked for the person in the anecdote in order to apply it to one’s own life (test it). Also not to go too deep into it, but the scientific method starts with an observation of an event and then a hypothesis on why it happens (before research can happen).</p>
<p>On the other hand someone trying to use “studies” to prove a point is typically using an argument from authority i.e. a “scientist” or “researchers” or some university etc. said this so it must be true (meaning the person speaking has shut off their brain when they heard the authority tell them what to think is true, and they are expecting you to do the same when they invoke the “authority”). Forget the fact that researchers are human beings with agendas and faults, and that without scientific literacy (and a significant investment of time and energy) it’s difficult to even know if the study was conducted well or if the conclusions match the data etc.</p>
<p>Welcome back. Glad to hear you enjoyed the vacation.</p>

<p>I had to think about this one for a while.  Then I realized that, generally, scientific “proof” is always about 20-50 years behind nonscientific evidence.<br/>
Radar took about 50 years between implementation (first) and for the theory which proved it worked to develop.<br/>
I was a long distance runner in college and high school, and I realized that the science of distance running was always about 20-40 years behind what the top elites were doing.  In fact what the top elites were doing guided the exercise physiologists in their research. That is it wasn’t until recently (past 10 years) that scientists validated the ideas of training from the 70s.  The US was terrible at distance running in the 90s because people listened to the scientists instead of doing what the successful people before them had done.<br/>
For me it is sometimes a tough pill to swallow because I am trained as a scientist.</p>

<p>Ha funny you bring up sports.</p>
<p>They have just proven “interval training works”…</p>
<p>That was being used well over 30 years ago.</p>
<p>This is also why all those body building workouts that don’t use band training = not real athletes at all. Band training is yet to be “proven” yet all the top guys and anyone who has played college sports knows it’s how you get more explosive.</p>

<p>Scientific research is the most misunderstood thing ever.<br/>
The guys who think something has to be “proven in controlled studies” to be true are the ones who understand it less.</p>
<p>The scientific process is slow and always comes last – and this is by design. Scientific research is made to check anecdotal wisdom in order to confirm it or disprove, and if it’s confirmed then build upon it. Saying “this is not proven” when something clearly works is like saying “you will probably be right in 30 years, but right now, you are not”.</p>
<p>This is why there are dietary restriction which are extremely powerful against some types of cancer, but they are buried in scientific articles about rats and are 10 years away from clinical trials. I know of people who dug out those articles and managed to achieve “excellent remission” by cutting out some food from their diet.<br/>
Is this “proof”, scientifically speaking? No. Statistically, there cannot be correlation. Still, if you have cancer, it only makes sense to try it as the worst that can happen is that it has no effect.</p>
<p>Scientific research was never meant to lead from the front. Neckbeards would like that, I guess, so to better argue under YT videos.</p>

<p>There’s actually an advantage with thinking like a scientist. While the job and career is centered around verifying theories….you should be able to actually see correlation quickly, and implement from there. </p>
<p>Research takes time to gather data, so it’s always going to be several steps behind those doing trial and error and implementing immediately after they get some positive feedback.</p>

<p>Hey, do you have any tips for making it in your mid thirties? I made the stupid decision of not wearing protection when I was younger and now have a massive liability lol. I have a degree in engineering and am a marine engineer in the Aus Navy. I’m going to work on submarines until mid 30s (I’m 31 now), it’s a hell of an adventure. Would I be able to give wall street a crack? I work a massive amount of hours and think this work ethic would be practical in any career. Any tips, hints?</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated</p>

<p>Generally unless your heart is set on the street we’d recommend sales instead.</p>
<p>As a side note, ability to work long hours is only valuable at the lowest ranks on Wall Street. After that it isn’t really required to be honest. You either generate revenue or you don’t regardless of time spent.</p>

<p>Not something to worry about Gary. Just live your life and have fun</p>
<p>You’re already rich. Just stay healthy and meet new people at your leisure. You should be stress free and not care about the opinions of anyone including us.</p>
<p>That actually emphasizes the point of the article. If you’re already successful just have fun teaching talented younger guys and living a fulfilling life that you deem interesting.</p>
<p>1) don’t compare yourself to anyone<br/>
2) improve on whatever item you want to improve on<br/>
3) don’t worry about what regular people think (they will hate on you and try to drag you down)<br/>
4) stay *healthy* and enjoy life</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>Nice to see you back WSP, hope you had a great time.</p>
<p>Here are some questions:</p>
<p>1) Being in online marketing, if I sell, for example, the implementation of a remarketing campaign, is that considered payment on a performance basis?</p>
<p>It sounds like a yes to me, because it can be outsourced and I will be paid for the project, not how long it takes me to create (nor how much money it makes though).</p>
<p>2) Regarding the referral fee, doesn’t it make sense in some cases to do the referral without a commission, just to create “goodwill”?</p>
<p>3) I am thinking of outsourcing chores as soon as I can fill my extra hours with income generating work, although I am younger than 30. Doesn’t this make sense, since I will be doing work that I will enjoy and probably make more money than the cost of outsourcing it?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>1) any form of sales is performance based<br/>
2) no. You don’t want friends who are unhappy you’re collecting a fee. If you’re solving a problem they shouldn’t care you made $XX on a referral since you just saved them several thousand dollars. Only refer top tier people<br/>
3) sure</p>

<p>I still struggle sometimes with research vs action,less and less as I get more life experience.</p>
<p>Some anecdotal evidence</p>
<p>I would  read book after book of songwriting theory, lyrics, song structure , etc..</p>
<p>*Some* progress following this method</p>
<p>Now I write as much as I can and then I go play them for the audience it was created</p>
<p>As I play them I notice at what parts they smile or  get excited. Which lyrics work. Which parts bore them or don´t get any emotional response. </p>
<p>A *lot* of progress with this method</p>
<p>It´s  no brainer once you see the results a few times</p>
<p>Great post, thanks</p>

<p>$0. If we wanted to actually monetize we would, no point. We just cover hosting costs with basic recommendations. </p>
<p>Blogging for money is a waste because you have to cater to idiots to make money (selling feelings). Much better to sell a product if you want money (sell products to women).</p>

<p>Slightly related to the topic of making money from recommendations: I have got several friends who are trying their hands at startups, some are successful and some are not. I often talk to them and brainstorm and advise them on one issue or another. What are some ways I can convert this into money? I don’t want to join their startup or start my own, which would be obvious ways of making money from startups. Another way is of course investing. Is there a third way? Something that does not involve commitment and may be gives proportionately low returns?</p>

<p>I’m a long-time follower, and the one who probably suggested this post topic a long long time ago.  Really happy it finally arrived.  Decently successful young finance/startup guy, early 30’s, low 7 figure net worth.  Personally, I lost a lot of interest in the blog when there were articles on why blogging doesn’t work (just don’t have time for it), sector overviews (technical overkill), logical and deep topics (I’m just a practical guy), and stuff catering to college kids (recruiting, etc – I’m way over that.).  Could tell the audience changed over time, and glad we’re back to where we started.  I’m amazed how you guys manage to keep topping the site with top notch information and advice over and over again.  The site itself is a godsend to any guy, any age out there trying to make something of himself.  The thing that surprises me so much is all the stuff you wrote above, I had to figure out myself. I just can’t imagine where I would be if I had this blog 5-10 years ago… There weren’t any blogs helping ambitious, hungry guys like myself and a bunch of us out there.  All the points are valid, and just a few personal comments<br/>
–	Used to do chores myself to save a few $.  Now, everything’s outsourced.<br/>
–	Action over books?  Anyone in banking knows literally every single day someone in the office is complaining about going out and starting their own business, but literally no one does so.<br/>
–	Anecdotal evidence – that’s how you do research and get insight beyond what everyone else knows… we’re always asking top CEO’s and management teams in private on industry trends and info.<br/>
–	3 forms of income – working on this.  This is really a tough one.  But obviously it needs to be done, just as much as diversifying your friends and the girls you’re dating.  Don’t put all the eggs in one basket…Super important.  People should get started on this one asap.<br/>
–	Millionaire or something went wrong – I understand how people can theoretically get there, and I’ve read your post already, but reality is harder than it seems.  Taxes are higher, living costs are higher, investments go south, startups fail, etc.<br/>
–	Risk tolerance – this is where things can go awry.  A commenter a few posts ago said he joined a successful entrepreneur, made a ton of money, and then put all that money into the same entrepreneur on the next venture and now is worth 8 figures.  Well, unfortunately, I know guys who did that same thing and came out with 0.  It’s really luck of the draw and risk tolerance of every individual.<br/>
–	Tougher to meet friends – that’s true.  But the true solid friends that you meet – you should be able to do anything for them, hands down, especially in times of trouble.  And they, the same.</p>
<p>Some random thoughts &amp; ideas – </p>
<p>Maybe another idea to write about might be how to portray confidence and success – more details and actions on voice intonation, public speaking, respect of peers,, always being surrounded by multiple attractive women, etc.  I’ve never been able to manage multiple women successfully as my mind always focuses on one.  How to be that great guy that everyone wants to know.  Sure, the money and health help, but practical items, like posture, dress, voice coaching, etc…</p>
<p>Another might be on personal happiness.  Who know’s what happened to those young bankers that passed away recently, but a lot of us just never find personal happiness, mental fulfillment or really know how to relax….how not to be so serious since we’re always working and trying to make things happen.  Personally, I’m a workaholic.  Even when I’m on vacation, I’m always thinking of new ideas or businesses.  And oftentimes bc of that, I just end up not being able to relax or end up really tired oftentimes.</p>
<p>Thanks guys from all of us.  And keep up the great work.</p>

<p>Fantastic! Glad to see you’re still around.</p>
<p>We will continue to do some of the posts you dislike (overviews etc).</p>
<p>But yes we’re moving on from the extremely young crowd. Gotta build the base and build up and out.</p>
<p>We have an extremely long post on happiness so maybe it didn’t address your question exactly? If there are holes we can fill, feel free to drop a comment and we’ll try to reword it.</p>

<p>“Maybe another idea to write about might be how to portray confidence and success…” </p>
<p>Stop worrying about portraying confidence and success. You *are* successful, even by this site’s standards. I’m sure you have set and achieved many of your own goals; goals that are significantly higher than the majority of the world’s population’s.</p>
<p>On an objective scale, you should therefore be several times more confident than 99% of people walking past your house, but our minds don’t work that way because we live in our own little worlds. Your world has higher standards. Your world compares you against your own past performance, not against the random guy walking past your house. That’s why you find it hard to be confident.</p>

<p>I agree. Best blog out there. The younger generation is so lucky to have this info now. No one out there is doing what you guys are doing. Your twitter and blog are exceptional. Too bad I didn’t have this when I was a teen. My mindset has shifted into over drive thanks to you guys. I read so many books, listened to audio books, watched videos, attended seminars, etc yet never found this info. Only so later I would have to unlearn everything that’s catered to the masses and learn the truth here. All I can say is thank you. Keep spreading the truth…</p>

<p>If someone or something can change your emotions, it is just a sales pitch.</p>
<p>Motivational stuff is specifically targeted at people who have failed at life. People who have failed at life are very easy to control from an emotional standpoint (they are also easy to sell to because if they accomplish anything at all, like picking up a  paperclip, they will feel good about themselves).</p>
<p>Long story short, broke people are extremely emotional and are easily sold on inspirational nonsense.</p>

<p>Can you make a post about using PED’s (Performance Enhancing Drugs) to remain in top physical shape even in your 30’s? </p>
<p>I know a lot of US special ops guys who are in their late 30’s who use TRT, HGH, EPO, etc. to have the bodies and testosterone levels of 25 year olds.</p>
<p>I think it could be a great competitive edge as not a lot of people talk about it (other than in professional sports)</p>

<p>I thought this was an outstanding post.  You touched on several universal truths for your thirties, many of which you likely started to notice in your late thirties.</p>
<p>Friends:  they are few and far between, and generally widely spread out geographically.  If they have a similar mentality, they are likely too busy to meet more than once a month.  Successful people don’t go for wing night on Wednesday, thirsty Thursdays at the local bar, out at the new hotspot Friday and Saturday, and spend the whole weekend hungover.  When you see them, they will have actual information and insight to share, other than who left the bar with whom on Saturday night at 2am.</p>
<p>Time management:  if you don’t get people telling you to “take it easy and live a little,” you’re doing it wrong.  You want to accomplish the most in the least time.  Time is a currency, spend it wisely.</p>
<p>Information:  loved this.  Most anecdotal evidence I have come across is health related.  Trying new things in the gym has led to large gains, unsupported by the latest “fitness guru.”  For me, oral hygiene is crucial.  I had a coach diagnose a player with a cavity because he kept spraining his ankles.  He never looked in his mouth, but was spot on. Backed by research?  No.  But accurate.  Same goes for mouthwash:  if I use it daily, I don’t get sick.  Full stop.  There are too many examples to go into detail, but I guess the main takeaway is to do you, don’t take an “expert opinion” as gospel.  </p>
<p>Delegation:  one of the few ways of buying yourself time.  My delegating is a work in progress, I struggle with having things done instead of perfect.  </p>
<p>One key thing to add:  pay it forward.  There are likely some people who mentored you and were crucial to your development.  Be willing to impart your knowledge by mentoring up and coming talent.  You will get increasing enjoyment out of this as you progress through your thirties (and life I presume).  Probably the biggest impacts you will have in your career will be on people, not numbers or a bottom line. Make lasting impressions.</p>

<p>One more thing that is a very important rule for your 30s – try to become a grey man. Keep a low profile and stay out of spotlight as much as possible. Not just to avoid attention but also to stop it from making you lose your focus / changing your personality.</p>
<p>As you become richer and more successful, you will attract opportunities that can get into your head if you are not careful. You can become arrogant and forget what made you successful in first place. Happened to me first time I touched 6 figure. It was models, bottles and fast cars. Thankfully it was almost 5-6 years ago for me and I have recovered and learnt the lesson there.</p>
<p>Also, importance of privacy and not rubbing your wealth in other people’s faces – last week an acquaintance of  mine was stabbed to death. He had a penchant for showing off his fast cars – a Ferrari and an Audi R8. </p>
<p>A 17 year old broke into his apartment and stabbed him. Motivation, as per police, was theft and envy. Sad because he was just 31 and highly successful. Also sad because he didn’t follow one basic rule – jealous people will do anything to bring you down.</p>
<p>My other very successful buddy does mid-7 figures per year. However, he is about as anonymous you can get here in a small eastern European country. Keeps a Porche (which doesn’t get flashy here unlike Ferrai, R8, Lambo, Maserati etc.) and makes regular trips where he rents these supercars, drives them to his heart’s desire and comes back to living an anonymous life.</p>
<p>Once again, excellent post. Just remember to: 1) never let any success you’ve had make you forget how you had it in first place (the stoicism book you guys recommend is excellent for it – read it quite some time ago, one of the best things to happen to me); and, 2) become a grey man, hide your success from normal people.</p>

<p>Great advice. You can use large amounts of money in rare occasions (birthday parties for friends etc.) but no reason to impress people who are just angling to burn you anyway.</p>

<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever moved to Wall St. without any qualifications, and got into a (sales) job with an extremely limited resume? It sounds like my kind of place.</p>
<p>I don’t want to add any negativity to this comment, but let’s just say I’m 28 and have been trying on my own for years to make something from nothing, and really need a fresh start somewhere.</p>
<p>To end with a positive point, I may not be where I want to be in life yet, but I’m not going to give up getting there.</p>

<p>Turned 28 earlier this year, and judging by the post (and just how life is heading in general), 30s are likely to be fairly exciting! </p>
<p>I worked really hard through my late teens and 20s, in just about every area of my life to improve the foundation – financially, socially, healthwise, building a solid network, building a solid social niche. All those investments are starting to slowly pay off now. </p>
<p>Although I now work in the tech industry, but I love your wall street posts as well (Worked as a quant for a BB earlier).</p>
