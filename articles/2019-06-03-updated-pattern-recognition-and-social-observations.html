</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>We try to do this at least once a year where we highlight new trends we’re seeing. Naturally, the trends we see will be related to the environment we’re in so you’ll get a clean glance at things we’ve been doing lately if you’re able to read between the lines. The range is quite wide from the upcoming generation (people in their early 20s) to ultra high-end where we’ve been lucky enough to hang out with some wealthy people out of our league (hey at least we got entrance to the cheap seats! Always want to be one of the worst people in the room if you want to get better). </p>
<p><strong>Ultra Rich People Quirks: </strong>We gave away our view of intelligence before, but in this case we’re just narrowing it down to ultra rich people. Ultra rich is defined as someone who will be worth $50M+ or is already worth $50M+. That is ultra rich by any logical person’s definition. We think $10M is actually doable but when you look at $50-100M+ it’s quite the jump and we’ve noticed some strange commonalities between the ultra rich.</p>
<p><em>Off Eye:</em> No we are not joking. Please google image search Charlie Munger, Jeff Bezos and Keith Rabois to start. You’ll find that in many images one of their eyes tends to close while the other one remains fully open. It’s extremely odd and once you see it you’ll see it more frequently when hanging out around wealthier people. No we’re not saying that people with strange eyes are all “geniuses” we’re just highlighting a pattern we’ve seen occur many times. There are many geniuses with normal eyes and messed up ones. After all, for decades people have assumed that having glasses implied you were smarter. There might be something to this given that we’ve noticed a strange trend over the past year or so. </p>
<p><em>High Pitch and Talking Patterns: </em>Another interesting one is that a lot of them have either 1) a high pitch, 2) a slight lisp, or 3) an odd repetitive phrasing. The first two are extremely easy to notice, a slightly higher pitch and a slight lisp. This is why cartoon characters of geniuses always have a strange speaking pattern as well (the cartoon Futurama is probably the best example of this). The third one has been picked up, Peter Thiel is a great example and even though his voice sounds relatively normal, he still states “the” two to three times in a row and has a constant “but um” phrase he uses quite frequently. Our best guess is that smart people have to think of a way to “dumb down” what they want to say for a wider audience. To do this they either repeat the same phrase a couple of times or take blatant pauses. Since they don’t really care about “appearing smart” since they are already rich, this results in odd speaking styles. For those that are still following the crypto currency space, the people in these arenas have the same issues cited in this paragraph (amped up at least 10x).</p>
<p><em>Focus on Ownership:</em> We’re going through this mental transition as well. Instead of trying to get cash flow numbers up, it eventually goes to a pure focus on ownership. While cash flow is certainly a top priority, the cash flow generated is a by product of ownership. If you own 10 different businesses that all deliver enough value to be profitable, it really doesn’t matter what the cash flow number is over a 10-year frame (under the assumption margins remain flat to up consistently). What matters? Making sure you have a large chunk of ownership so you can control the direction of the business/assets. The same concept rings true, you don’t want “money” you want “wealth” which is anything that generates money for you without the use of your time. </p>
<p><em>Very Fast and Judgmental: </em>If people really believe we talk too “matter of factly”… we recommend they enter into a wealthy environment. When we say “wealthy environment” we don’t mean a conference where they fake being happy go lucky and “anyone can make it” type attitude. We mean a closed door situation where everyone is trying to compete and get somewhere. You’ll see a much more vicious side to the rich. They will immediately judge your worth with a single glance or 2 minute conversation. Seriously. We thought we were terrible with this type of attitude and what we learned is that we need to step it up dramatically.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> If your first sentence doesn’t prove your worth, you’re wasting their time.</em></span> If someone reads this whole blog we’d say that is the main takeaway we’d write down at this point. You should be able to prove your value in a sentence or less. It is absolutely ruthless out there as everyone wants “attention” from rich people but they don’t have time to listen to a life long story. </p>
<p><strong>Slimming Optionality: </strong>This is really for people in their 20s. The number of openings for high paying positions are coming down and this seems to be reflected in the culture in two ways: 1) people no longer interested in having kids – both men and women and 2) significant change in the type of people that go out at night. This one is hard to explain but we’ll try. The most attractive women are either going out to the most expensive places or they are giving up entirely and going out a lot more during the day. The number of attractive people you see walking around a park vs just 5-years ago is dramatic. This might be an east coast thing so we’re interested in hearing about the general answer here but it’s pretty clear. Women are actually taking the time to look nice and go out during the day since they don’t want to go to bars/clubs unless they are ultra high-end (which is becoming less economical). Its actually a lot more common to see higher quality women in restaurants and parks than the clubs lately (again exception is ultra high-end and luxury house parties). </p>
<p>Our best guess is that the college culture has only gotten crazier with everyone hooking up with everyone else. Especially the people in the “upper middle” of attractiveness. The top tier ones (with brains) won’t do this but it’s pretty easy to imagine a bunch of 7s sleeping around town since they have tons of debt a very little to look forward to. Another one we’d bet on is an increase in general anxiety levels (panic attacks) as a lack of “going somewhere” looms over many people. </p>
<p>On the positive side of the ledger after those two negative observations, the quality of life has gone no where but up. Even low income people have access to fast internet and information if they like. So we’re living in the best age in history (platinum age) to get rich… It’s just a small number that actually make it. We’re going to look into this information at the end of the year. We’d bet the tail distribution of earnings is showing up even for people in their mid-late 20s. Meaning even people who are 5-7 years out of college have incredibly large differences in terms of earnings (heavily skewed distribution). </p>
<p><em>Lifestyle Observation:</em> All of this builds up to a strong pattern we have seen over the last couple of years. People who have high social skills are working less while earning large amount of money while those that have poor social skills are working incredibly long hours all of the time. This makes a lot of sense. Remember, we’re only referring to high income people in this paragraph (and blog in general at this point). If you have a high income, you either have lots of fun so you don’t care about making 30% more. And. If a person has weak social skills, their entire “self worth” becomes their career/business so they just keep working long hours forever. It is amazing to watch real time at around age 30. This is the easiest time in your life for social skills, energy and money. So if the person cannot have fun with everything working in his favor… he’s not going to figure it out and ends up focusing all of his effort on making tons of cash. To make matters worse, the guys who have good social lives and make good money don’t want to help these other rich people since they are likely “downers” to any event they would have. If you don’t need money there is no reason to ruin your personal life to make a few extra bucks.</p>
<p><em>Women Appear More Aware: </em>Again. This is referring to attractive women, not your run of the mill person. They seem to have caught on to this shift in resources/quality of men. So you see the same girls trying to get into the same circles. They avoid the common person like the plague. Can’t believe this is being written out in print, but over the last 5-years it appears that high quality good looking women are starting to make changes to their strategies. This is probably due to socioeconomic adjustments more than anything else. And. It could also be dead wrong and we’re just benefitting from the move up the ladder. </p>
<p><strong>Increased Insecurity: </strong>Combining the two prior concepts we’re seeing a pretty large increase in insecurity. Men and women appear more and more insecure. This is highlighted by the skyrocketing growth of plastic surgery and the increased number of guys who get “upset” if you buy something expensive. The women probably feel pressure to look better due to Instagram filters and most guys (97% that don’t even make it to a million) feel that they should be better than everyone else. Our basic observation (and prediction) is that this will continue for the next five years at minimum. The more attractive women are waking up to the fact that there are smaller high quality options out there (increase plastic surgery to compete) and more guys will talk about “minimalism” since they can’t produce due a lack of talent (this also leads to hate against anything material). </p>
<p>As a bonus, the increased insecurity appears to be spreading into the “mens” section as well. Male grooming is a popular growth area (yes seriously) and we won’t be surprised to see this increase in the future as well. If you have no skills/talent and can’t make money, then your next best option is to become as attractive as possible to try and somewhat level the playing field (at least until age 40 or so). We’re not against this strategy at all (as a temporary fix), it just shows how much has changed in a few short years. To put the bow on this section, if this continues we wouldn’t be surprised to see men go through basic surgeries in the future as well (most likely liposuction). </p>
<p>Looking at this section you’d think an increase in “materialism” would result from increased insecurity. The catch? The average person doesn’t have money. So the best they can do is a one time change to fix something and appear better looking. We’ve gone from insecure people buying BMWs/Mercedes to having plastic surgery and budgets for grooming/liposuction. It’s essentially the same market just spun in a different direction. After typing that up, should really consider normalizing surgery for men and profiting off referrals. In summary, the new “insecure” spend a lot more money on physical improvements as they are less costly, stand the test of time (usually) and don’t come off as materialistic. </p>
<p><strong>Increased Unhappiness: </strong>Another one we’ve noticed is that the vast majority of the population is unhappy in the USA. This has actually gotten worse from 2010 (at least it appears that way). In fact, it’s so common you can tell what a person thinks of you based on this comment alone. If you have your life together and are thrilled (you should be) anyone who says you’re “unhappy negative” is really saying “I don’t like you”. Since you’re a reflection of what they “could have become” as everyone believes they are the best, they have to come up with something negative to say that is intangible. </p>
<p>So as a useful social skill test, you can figure out who everyone likes or dislikes within a group by saying “that guy/girl is so happy all the time don’t you think”. This seems like an innocent comment but their reaction to you will tell you what *they* think, which is the information you were searching for in the first place. If you meet someone new and tell someone else you think he/she is a happy guy/girl, they will now be forced to reveal if they like or dislike the person. It really is that simple these days. Luckily this blog is niche so people won’t be using it any time soon. Take it to the end and it makes logical sense as well. Do you have any friends that you think are “always unhappy”? No. Hence why this social trick works so well and has been working so well for us the past 3 years or so.</p>
<p><strong>Severe Change in Fashion: </strong>You can tell a lot about someone simply by the way they dress. In the past, fashion seemed to be more similar. It was not easy to figure out a persons social life by their clothing… Now? It seems to be quite easy. In fact, its so blatant we can even see it in the corporate world. The type of suit a guy wears and the color ties he puts on tell you everything. Hint hint, the guys with nice accessories and a suit that doesn’t fit correctly is the standard insecure corporate guy. The guy with everything tailored with the colors matching… that’s the guy partying as soon as the day is over. </p>
<p><strong>Emotions at Work: </strong>We read a book on management earlier this year called “No Hard Feelings”. Holy smokes. The content wasn’t mind blowing but the realization that there can be so many emotions at work. When you’re busy outsourcing as much as you can you forget how many people are dealing with office politics day in and day out. “No one quits a bad job, they quit a bad manager” appears to be more true today than it has been in the past 10 years. </p>
<p>As a quick summary, assume that everything you write to anyone who works for you will obsess over every detail from the time you sent it to the number of periods and exclamation points you use. As a repetitive secondary summary, for the love of God, do not hire anyone you do not have to hire. The book really highlights how irrational people are (that was our takeaway). Since the new generation has grown up staring at a computer screen/smartphone all day, they really read into every single detail since they are trained to do this. Photos, word choices, length of message… everything. </p>
<p>The general item to look out for? Expect people to spend more free time with their co-workers. Since people are becoming less family oriented and more focused on their work being their “identity” you should see more of this. This of course goes directly against our advice of assuming your co-workers are not your friends (they aren’t). So you’re in luck if you found this blog. Your co-workers are going to be busy making friends at work while you’re busy building up your own biz and improving paid performance metrics at work (KPIs).</p>
<p>Our next post is going to be on markets/businesses we think will grow over the next several years. The beginning of this post essentially gives away “how we got the ideas” which is just a collection of consensus ideas from ultra rich people. Hopefully this post is of value to someone trying to make the next jump in life since we’ve given away very clear clues to pick out the winners in any crowd through social tells. (Yes this was also written on a phone, a new strategy while the longer posts will be saved for a laptop)</p>

<p>The eye comes from lazy eye or being cross eyed at birth and getting surgery to correct it.  Source: I have it.</p>
<p>I’m also ~135 IQ according to a psychologist I dated and asked me to take an IQ test for her to practice.   I also learned to not talk like a book / go into little professor mode when I was a kid, lest I bore people.  I usually really worry about it and try to take the Feynman approach of “If you can’t explain something to a first year student, then you haven’t really understood it”</p>
<p>I wouldn’t put too much into lazy eye = smart although.</p>
<p>Not as judgemental since I am lazy as fuck, just another tech worker saving up money.  I can’t get myself to start a side biz because I tell myself I really don’t care about actually doing most of my ideas.</p>

<p>Not sure if your problem is laziness per se. I am also at that IQ level and knowing others in the 130++ range I have noticed a (sometimes extreme) aversion towards simple/ tedious/repetitive tasks that require less intellectual horsepower. A lot of them are going into research because of this sacrifing material rewards. I wonder if you have come up with any suggestions on how to deal with this over the years.</p>

<p>Good point. </p>
<p>Another issue could be that intelligent people have a different definition of hard work (compared to society). </p>
<p>I just passed pharmacy school and I can’t say I ever put more than 5% effort, even though most people would consider my studying “hard work.” Even an 80 hour work week isn’t really hard work since I know senior citizens in the 3rd world who do more than that (My parents are from India). </p>
<p>I personally feel lazy as hell because of this.</p>

<p>To Deep: 80 pure hours of studying is nearly impossible imo. Whoever says they are doing this are probably lying to themselves. Perhaps for some small period of time and for easy subjects. As for the 3rd world country comment, low working rights is a big part why you don’t wanna be there in the first place man, don’t beat yourself up about this lol. </p>
<p>Also perhaps the reason you don’t feel you are putting in much work is because the material is easy for you and you don’t feel like a unit of time spent is much work. Medical subjects are a lot of memorizing. High IQ is rewarded more in STEM fields were the input is highly compressible requiring higher levels of concentration -many more connections and implications between the concepts you learn, allowing you to maximally utilize your intelligence.</p>

<p>I don’t really have a solution.  I have a sneaking suspicion recently that I might have minor ADHD, but my high intelligence &amp; sometimes hyper-focus style might be papering over that effect.  My father and grandfather recently got a diagnosis.  Maybe an ADHD Rx and Modafinil &amp; Adderall would help, but I got a feeling deep down it wont after seeing how they are tools, like drinking a lot of coffee.</p>
<p>The work I do in a tech company isn’t that significant, but fun and somewhat interesting at times.   But it pays well.</p>
<p>The real issue is me telling myself, I can work 20 hours a week extra to maybe make an outlier success side business like nomad list or I can just be a careerist and learn how to get that next promotion until I hit E6 (which I’m close to I think) or E7 at something like Google or FB and make $500k-$750k/yr eventually and have a much nicer life.</p>
<p>Through some good negotiation and offer shopping a few years ago, I’m looking at the past 4 years being at $500-$600k/yr at an E5 level for example.  I could possibly do that again by shopping for the next IPO superstars or going to FANG at E6 and maybe hit a million or just pull in the $500k?  It’s fueled by sky stock market valuations although, so I don’t know how long it would last.</p>
<p>I keep on telling myself I’ll start making that business when this tech bubble finally pops but it’s been 8 years already when I thought this bubble just gotta pop!</p>
<p>I also look at a guy who’s younger than me and is already E6, works out 6 days a week consistently and works harder than I did at my age and look at my work ethic being about %50-75 of his and not working out consistently.   That’s why I call myself lazy because I know I can do better.</p>
<p>I really do appreciate what WSP has shown and opened my eyes to do better, and I keep it in the back of my mind as a benchmark.  Trying to mentor some of my other tech friends and seeing how they don’t really hook on to it, I realize that it’s important to show people the way, but to not expect that they will hook into it.</p>
<p>(See levels.fyi for an explanation of tech career ladders like E6 or E5)</p>

<p>The off eye thing is real. Although to be fair to Charlie Munger, he had a botched eye surgery. I don’t know if it’s a nurture or nature thing. Possibly nurture because these people tend to have been staring at a screen or reading books for many hours since they were young. You don’t need depth perception to look at a flat surface, so you only need 1 eye. On the other hand, I haven’t met many people with lazy eyes like Jeff Bezos, but bizarrely they were all highly intelligent. I wonder if it’s a high intelligence mutation. </p>
<p>I don’t see a clear pattern about the high voice, lisp thing. I mean, you used Peter Thiel as an example. He’s gay, which also has that stereotype. Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett don’t have high voices or lisps. Bill Gates kind of has a high voice. The repeating words thing could be due to highly intelligent people having a lot of thoughts, which they can’t express quickly enough. Stutters supposedly have so many thoughts the brain can’t process which to express. I don’t think it’s about dumbing things down. </p>
<p>Rich people are super judgmental. They’re hyper aware of their time. For the average person, half the people they are going to meet are going to be better than them and interesting. For super rich people, who are better than 99.99% of people, it statistically doesn’t make sense to talk to random people, especially with your time so precious. You either go to pre-selected areas like Davos or only talk to people you’re introduced to by other super rich people you know. </p>
<p>Ownership over everything. Felix Dennis talks about this. </p>
<p>Inequality, and all it’s effects on the SMV market, is definitely a secular trend.</p>

<p>Google search “retinoblastoma and iq”. It’s a form of eye cancer . Individuals that test positive for it and their relatives have higher than average IQ. Even the relatives that don’t develope the cancer get a boost, although less than the individuals that do get the cancer. A non-cancerous copy of the gene could be the reason they have eye issues yet haven’t lost the eye.</p>

<p>I think it might come from all the reading we might do?  I like reading a lot.  I liked it since I was a small child. It used to be more books but now it’s just endless amounts of hacker news and blog articles and twitter.  It’s a bit of a problem because I spend several hours a day at work doing it and then several hours at home and on my commute.   People do say I do know a lot of random stuff too although as a result.</p>
<p>I blast myself for not really reading books anymore, but then I see thing like this: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128141852/https://andymatuschak.org/books/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://andymatuschak.org/books/</a></p>
<p>That reminds me although, with books taking about 10 hours in his estimate, maybe I should be reading more books.  I think a problem about books is that I want to netflix binge them, and I find that too much of an interruption in my life.  But at the same time, they can’t really keep my attention anymore like they used to.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s about dumbing things down.”</p>
<p>It definitely is, in some cases.</p>
<p>When I managed higher intelligence cold call salesmen, I had to teach them to insert “ums” and “uhs” way more than they usually would, either as a pause (to give listener a break from thinking) or as a punctuation (to prime listener to receive the next point).</p>
<p>I did this because I myself talk and think way too fast to communicate with the average person and so had to find some kind of tactic to bridge the gap and makes sales to eat/live.</p>

<p>Not surprised. I have come to realize that the biggest emotional sheep are “blue collar”  office employees. </p>
<p>These sheep are the most annoying class and literally believe that they are higher up in society. They think that some promotion or successful completed project is success. </p>
<p>Big take away here if that you have to herd this sheep…have them believe they truly are successful..less chance they leave and saves you money rehiring. </p>
<p>Not surprised at the 50m net worth ownership is the main mindset. You don’t get to that net worth with out it.. </p>
<p>The culture is degrading and it’s another business opportunity. As the masses get depressed I can think of 10 products that you can to  market to them from the top of my head…</p>
<p>Excited for your next post on business opportunities!</p>

<p>The 80/20 rule is turning into the 95/5 rule for us millennials, especially when it comes to SMV. </p>
<p>Example I’ll never forget: My campus has a competing bodybuilder (not overly big, has the body most guys aim for). He wasn’t considered good looking enough by one of my female friends, who is 6/10 on her best day. </p>
<p>It’s depressing when you’re in the bottom 95%. But on the other hand, this is exciting as hell because the prize for getting into the top 5% is higher than ever!</p>

<p>Medical professional here. </p>
<p>Medicine for money depends highly on the field. If u can break into plastics, dermatology or ENT, u can make mad cash in short period after residency.</p>
<p>Also, theres plenty of opportunity for side hustles (and swindling clients – if u are unscrupulous) as a doctor.</p>
<p>Dunno why WSPs take such a negative approach to medicine for making money.</p>
<p>If ur in medicine because u “care” about the patients, ur doing it wrong, imo.</p>

<p>Then I’d look for the following: Thin bone structure + Transient eyes (not much eye contact) in addition to what you guys said.</p>
<p> I dont know why but I’ve honestly never met a highly intelligent person with even a slight powerlifting predisposition. They all tend to have small wrist perimeter, and are thin with very-hard-to-get-fat type of bone structure.</p>

<p>Interesting re: Thin bone structure</p>
<p>In the book sapiens they say as humans evolved, our muscles atrophied (vs the great apes) because our larger brains diverted much of the energy away from the muscle tissue (brain takes 25% of human energy vs 8% of an apes energy)</p>
<p>So that would make sense from an evolutionary perspective.</p>

<p>The tip is great to check if someone likes/dislikes someone.</p>
<p>Personally, I use a different version though.</p>
<p>Compliment anyone that both you and the person you are talking to know.</p>
<p>Depending on their reaction you can gauge if they don’t like the person, if they feel threatened, if they are comfortable, if they genuinely agree or casually say they haven’t noticed.</p>
<p>With this simple process you can very easily screen pretty much everyone you want to be closer with and those you keep as acquaintances.</p>
<p>Based on actual results, I’d say 99% feel threatened even for superfluous things! It’s very funny to observe</p>

<p>Regarding the eye thing: I have a weird eye and run a software consulting firm. Not rich yet though, only a year outta college so I doubt it counts for anything. But. My brother lost his eye when young to retinoblastoma, a form of eye cancer. He’s a quant and smart as hell. Retinoblastoma is tied to higher IQ, which makes sense in his case.

<p>Wrong, they learned to do that. When you have eye contact problem that is very frustrating so you wanna get better and you do that by forcing; which leads to bullying. Talking from personal experience.</p>

<p>“And. If a person has weak social skills, their entire “self worth�? becomes their career/business so they just keep working long hours forever.�?</p>
<p>I think this is part of the reason for the huge malaise you see today with people having their career be their identity, due to lack of social skills/life. </p>
<p>I was exactly like this until I realized that I was just trading my labor power for $, stupid way to make it as noted by you guys and that ownership is key. Similar sentiment echoed in Bullshit Jobs.</p>

<p>Work in politics as a side gig and a few noticeable patterns for the rich are:</p>
<p>Events:</p>
<p>– Majority of events similar to the masses held by the rich are shorter. ex. what takes place at a 4hr gala, is easily accomplished in 2.5 with only people that have a defined purpose to be there, and not just seat fillers(and higher quality of course)</p>
<p>– At longer events they are invited to, they show up late and leave early. Not to be rude, but for time value.</p>
<p>-People go out of their way to connect with them.</p>
<p>– They are there for a strategic purpose, and it is not surface level of just meeting people and “having fun”, or “networking”</p>
<p>-At the end of a conversation, IF they give you their business card(which they seldom do) there is usually an expectation tied to it. meaning: you can bring value to them and they are giving you a chance.</p>
<p>-They enjoy the esoteric. Imagine after a decade going to 100’s of “high end” events with the same format, the same food, and the same people it gets mundane.(This is also an indicator of a higher purpose than just attending) Knowing this, if you happen to get a few minutes of their time you can move well if you bring value.</p>

<p>I have never seen such a turn of attitude from a best friend and even my own dad! The Insecurity is oozing out of them, I believed humans could be rational. LOL, everyone, including family, think they are better than you.</p>

<p>Damn this is really interesting, why?</p>
<p>I am born on the same day as Jeff Bezos which is Jan 12th.</p>
<p>And I have the same lazy eye shit as him in the left eye that droops exactly the same way as him.</p>
<p>Also I am extremely judgemental, within seconds I typically judge people and never talk to them again based on those judgements.</p>
<p>Really interesting to me because I felt like you were describing me and then I saw that.</p>

<p>You mentioned upgrading sleep a few posts ago. Finally noticed how poor my mattress was and need upgrade</p>
<p>For a topic, would you recommend best mattresses/frames/products( eyeblinders) for cheap ( still grinding) and high end markets in post/tweet/book, </p>
<p>Also on the bullet proof vests- dont skimp on the material or having the side plates with a tight plate carrier fit. Certain weaves for holding the plates and catching knives is important. Not just a gen2 camo set picked up from army navy surplus</p>
<p>Sometimes, i feel my skills are better in down markets. High markets are just another barrier to enter the elites</p>

<p>As someone who has been in NYC for a bit and explored the social scene of the city, I seem to notice a trend here when it comes to women.</p>
<p>1. Meatpacking and the “hot” nightlife spots are almost always all Bridge and Tunnel on the weekends, usually some Jersey girl trying hard to overcompensate for her lower status (aka being from Jersey) and her crew of try-hard guys. For a while Le Bain was an exception to this as Europeans would come to party but even that is becoming taken over by Bridge and Tunnel and tourists. Lots of selfie attempts at Manhattan rooftop bars? Bank on it being a Jersey girl.</p>
<p>2. Going off of one, wherever the Bridge and Tunnel goes, the higher status crowd runs. Almost like a social white flight but race is not involved here, it kind of shows the differentiation between stealth wealth and try hard. Your typical Manhattanites are partying in low key areas where the hottest women chase them while some kid from Jersey or Staten Island is flashing hard.</p>
<p>3. Nightlife is more on the decline now, people head out in groups for the large part and you will be lucky to find girls heading out in smaller groups. Larger groups mean they are harder to game since they are there to have their own fun time.</p>
<p>4. Social media game is the new thing. Hot girls will salivate over men who portray a top tier life on social media.</p>
<p>5. College is not a wild as it used to be, it seems like people have more fun now in their 20s out of college since men are so scared of the dreaded FRA.</p>
