<p>In a change of pace we’re going to talk about the past and emphasize how quickly things can change in just 5-10 years. In such a short period of time it is possible to switch from being a “consumer” to a “producer”. It is possible to start billion dollar companies and it is is possible to change your life in a positive or negative direction quite dramatically. The odd thing about making dramatic shifts is that you have an extremely hard time remembering how it all happened. There is no “one event” that signifies a shift but more of a snowball of events that occur getting you to the destination. Hopefully a lot of the items below will either be 1) something you relate to or 2) something you will relate to in about 5-10 years. </p>
<p><strong>Producer vs Consumer Calendar: </strong>These calendars are not the same at all. Say what you will about “every rich person is different” but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128015954/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/a-guide-on-how-to-spot-rich-people/">there are always a lot of similarities</a>. Here are a few: December and January are some of the worst months. New years isn’t much of an event as you’re usually planning real events (promotions, products etc to start off 2019) which occur in January. February and March is a nightmare due to tax season and organizing an insane amount of paperwork. April – June is more stable. July – August is significantly more relaxing. September-October is similar to June and July. That’s a good general guideline of what a year looks like for someone who is in the producer camp. In fact, this kind of helps explain the whole “miserable rich person” stereotype/belief. During the holidays they are much more focused work and the last thing they are worried about is decorations (they are probably the ones shipping all those items!) </p>
<p>The consumer calendar or what we would call the normal person calendar is just not the same. If you’ve been in the lower class or middle class its pretty similar in terms of the calendar. January – March there is a lot of work as most people in this group are employees trying to ramp a new product/business line. April is okay since there is no significant work for a W-2 filing. May is similar to February. June to August is relaxing as most of the higher ups are on vacation. September – Mid-November is a last second grind similar to January to March. Mid-November to December is incredibly slow. This is quite different from the prior paragraph and should give a good overview of how your own priorities will change. </p>
<p>As a fun note to sign off on this sub-section, 2018 was the first year where no contacts messaged with “what are you doing for New Years”. Everyone already knows what is happening… Absolutely nothing. You’re spending your time ramping on new projects and trying to set up 2019 so that your total income is up year-over-year. No guarantees on your income, but, working hard when everyone else is busy watching football and eating is usually a good formula for success. </p>
<p><strong>Billions Over 10 Years: </strong>When you go out at night it’s hard to remember how fast things have changed. We’re using a few years of wiggle room. But. There was no iPhone, no Uber/Lyft, no Instagram and no Airbnb. Sure the first iPhone came out in 2007 and Airbnb was founded in August 2008, yet the point remains… A ton can change in just 10 years. In fact when you go out to eat, drink or party, the chances you talk to someone who was born to remember life “before the internet” is quite slim. At this point it is hard to remember flip phones let alone life before WiFi. <em>The main point here is that you only really need one good product to get rich</em>. Realistically we’ll take the under on creating the next Uber since the chances are so slim… But… Creating $100,000 or $200,000 business? Sure easily achievable. This is not a “for us comment” and is a for “for you” comment as we think it’s possible for quite literally anyone. </p>
<p>Flipping it around to the potential negative… in a word socio-economic changes. Taking a look over the last 10-years you’ll have to chalk up a lot of success to luck. In fact, we’d question anyone who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128015954/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/creating-luck/">does not believe in luck</a> if they made it to a million dollars or more (you need a little luck) in a short time frame. Luck cuts both ways and many people can fall into the “Have Nots” quickly. This is something we’ve noticed in dramatic fashion. By the time people are 30 they are squarely stuck treading water or they’ve made enough money to not have serious worries ever again. It is excruciatingly rare to see someone in-between and if they are it’s usually someone with more time freedom and a not as much money (traveling but clearing $80-120K a year). <em>The #1 cause of this downfall based on our own analysis is relying on a single form of income to pay bills.</em> Looking back, having a secondary source of income that can cover at least 40-50% of your living expenses is enough to change your life forever. If you were making around $100,000 a year after taxes and another person was making $60,000 and $40,000… We’ll bet on the second guy making it 10 times out of 10. There is something mental/physiological that happens when you realize you will always have some money coming in. It makes your main income producing work improve and at the same time your cash flows will unlikely go into the red any time soon. </p>
<p>What does this mean? It means we wouldn’t be surprised to see more tension between the “haves” and the “have nots” over the next few years. There has been a distinct cultural shift that is difficult to ignore unless you’ve stayed in a bubble the past decade. More and more people are searching for ways to make it into the “top of the triangle” and the people at the top are becoming more and more annoyed at the constant asks. Unlike the positive solution in the above paragraph we have no answer to this one. As more and more automation comes out and it becomes harder for individuals to add value to a process, this will lead to more consolidation of money to the top. If you’re good at reading between the lines, this is one of the reasons why we’re against student debt for anything that can’t be paid back rapidly (a year or two post graduation). It is related since student debt forces the graduate to “break even” for several years before being able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200128015954/http://wallstreetplayboys.com/investing-10-doesnt-work-run-the-numbers-get-rich-fast-instead/">gain any investment momentum</a>. </p>
<p><strong>What Used to Work Changes: </strong>One of the main reasons why generational wealth doesn’t work and why parents aren’t always the best people to ask for advice is this: change of value. 30 years ago it made complete sense to go to college. No one was doing it and it would get you far ahead in a legitimate career. This is the same for the typical MBA program as well where obtaining a top tier MBA resulted in a significant increase in earnings. If you look at the same strategy today… the Math doesn’t add up so well. The hardest part about looking back on what worked in the past is admitting that it is no longer a viable strategy. Similarly, if you go back and look at interest rates in 2006, they were at 5%… If this blog was around then it would say “just park your money in 5-6% returns and focus all your energy on a business/career”. Instead that strategy blew up and had to be revised. </p>
<p>While these items are all in hindsight, if we look at what is happening today.. the same repeated mistakes are happening again. A good example of this is going into a fund raising position. While this has historically been a smart way to make money as you’re taking a spread on large money raises, the space is becoming less and less lucrative. Spotify direct listed for an IPO without fees and Slack may do the exact same. At the lower levels of fund raising it is also becoming easier and easier to obtain money directly from individuals and this is only going to accelerate in the future. As this continues (that’s our bet of course so it is biased), what you’re going to see is a contraction of fees and more value being shifted to positions where actual returns can be justified. The easiest example would be real estate where the agent can at least add to the process by helping you negotiate a higher/lower price and build a business around being an exceptional seller/buyer. This adds a lot to the process and is completely unrelated to someone simply connecting two people who have never met (becoming increasingly easy to find them via a search or your own personal contacts). </p>
<p>For fun if we look back over the last 10 years here are some things that no longer work: 1) levering up for education without specific knowledge and the ability to repay quickly, 2) ignoring the stock market and having risk free returns drive your net-worth, 3) paying for any type of education that leads to no increase in income, 4) working in a position that can be quickly automated – vast majority of ad purchasing and bulk of manual labor and 5) large number of brick and mortar businesses due to high-cost and barriers to entry (Amazon killing pricing by commoditizing the offering). There are a lot more but we picked out 5 that are difficult to argue against – even for the people who don’t understand statistics and enjoy the whole “exception to the rule argument”. Also as a note, one strange industry has stood the test of time and that appears to be real estate. At the end of the day people need somewhere to live so it’s hard to shoot blanks here.</p>
<p><strong>Physics Applies to Life: </strong>“Objects in Motion Stay in Motion”. While this is a phrase usually reserved for physics we’d say it’s a much better rule for life in general. If you have upward momentum or downward momentum… it is quite difficult to turn that ship around the longer you stay in that same direction. A good way to think about it is added weight. If you’re in the ocean and driving a boat, every year weight is added to the boat. By the time you’re 40-50 years old or so, the direction is already set and you can’t really do much to suddenly change course unless a dramatic event occurs. You’re either headed to live in Antarctica at that point or Miami Beach. </p>
<p>To see if someone is moving in the right direction is based on how much they have invested as a percentage of total earnings over a 10-year span. Add up all of the earnings over a 10-year period (after taxes of course) and figure out how much the person has kept. We’d go ahead and wager that if the number is below 25-30% or so… momentum isn’t on their side yet. This only gets exacerbated over time. If someone has made $2M over the course of their 10 year frame and has $1 million that isn’t even close to someone with $500,000 as they are 7-10 years behind already. The difference is less related to the dollars they have and is more related to the time that they can purchase. The first person simply needs to pay the bills for 7-10 years to live a comfortable life, while the second person has to build and pay the bills to get to the same two million dollars. Not even close to comparable. </p>
<p>Graphically it is essentially a line chart. If you’re starting at zero, the original direction doesn’t make a big change initially. A chart with an exponential looks pretty similar to a chart with a steep vertical line for the first 5-6 iterations. Once you look out twenty iterations… the charts don’t look similar at all. One looks like it is going to a different destination entirely while the other appears to be flatlining. Does this mean you have to grow exponentially out of the blocks? No. Does it mean you have to find a way to make the curve turn up exponentially and compound? Yes. </p>
<p>Generally, if you’re younger it’s hard to tell which people are on the linear path versus the exponential path. To decide if it’s the correct one (without numbers) is the phone check. If you look back 10-years and are talking to the exact same people, that’s usually a bad sign. It is a bad sign since the person hasn’t moved into any new direction and the chances that the right person was found on day one is highly unlikely. Typically you have contacts you’ve known for 10 years or so… But… It’s highly unlikely you’ll talk to them frequently (a couple perhaps). Another good general rule is the skills you have to earn income. If it has been 6-8 years and there is only one way to earn money (with reasonable likelihood) this also sets up negatively for the next 10-15 years. </p>
<p><strong>Decisions Compound: </strong>Take a look at every major decision that is made and they will likely compound in a big way over 10 years. Some big ones are 1) your first field of work, 2) your first location to live, 3) the amount you invest between ages 21-25 and 4) the amount of leverage you take on related to consumer goods vs. financial assets. If these four decisions are made correctly it’s almost impossible to *not* start with the “line graph” moving in the right direction. Undoing any of these four is like climbing out of an enormous hole in the ground. Instead of focusing on small decisions that might make a few extra dollars here and there (or save a few extra dollars) the fixed costs, linearity of compensation and investment percentage will determine the slope of the graph. In fact if you talk to someone who has amassed a high net worth, they can usually pin point only 3-4 events that really changed their life. Yes the grind and 100s of hours of work are a given… Yet… it consistently comes down to a few key decisions. </p>
<p>Financial leverage is the best explanation here. If you buy any asset on 4x leverage your gains are not made immediately (unless you get lucky or flip the asset like a fixer upper house). Generally what happens is the spread between the rate of return and the cost of paying down debt creates a value gap. If we think about this further and include inflation it means the “cost of carrying debt” goes down even if your return is just enough to cover the payments. Now we would never recommend levering up to buy an asset that doesn’t generate a return well ahead of the interest rate on the debt. Yet. Even a break even number isn’t a loss since you’re using someone else’s money to give you an asset. </p>
<p><strong>Time Flies By: </strong>Another interesting thing you’ll notice is that age makes time blow by. There is no way to pin point exactly why this is, but it is likely because each year becomes a smaller percentage of the total life you’ve lived. If you are twenty years old, two years is 10% of your entire life. When you reach forty, two years is just 5% or less than half. So on and so forth. So when you look at the gains you make from age 20 to thirty from a percentage standpoint they look incredibly high and replicating this gain is quit difficult. Similarly, this begins to blur the years together. You’ll look back and say “I’ve known you for 6 years?” or “We used to think $XXX was successful”? </p>
<p>This brings us to a theory on trust. If you’ve lived to age 40… anyone who made it has been a close colleague/friend for about 20 years if you knew them since college (50% of your life). If you were fortunate to know someone since you were kids, that would expand the percentage to a whopping 80-90% or so. Naturally, as you get older the number of people you’re going to trust then goes down. This is an interesting way to take more risk if you’re older. A form or risk taking for someone in their 30s-40s who is looking to “level up” again should give more responsibility to younger people that they do not know as well. Feel free to take that to an extreme or less extreme.  </p>
<p><strong>Trying to Survive: </strong>The last one is similar to the “what used to work changes” theme. Essentially, it’s hard to blame people for making mistakes when an entire generation (10-20 years older) is pressing them to go into something that no longer works. While we could say that a 20 year old should be smart enough to to figure out these types of decisions on their own… it just isn’t as easy when you include the *amount* of pressure instilled on the younger generation. If your entire family and the school system forces you down a specific path, it isn’t easy to step back and say no particularly since you’re cutting loose a fall back plan. At the end of the day each generation is simply trying to survive so they encourage the younger generation to go down a path that gives them the highest probability chance of survival (life is difficult for the majority). Ironically, the highest probability chance of survival is rooted in un-teachable skills which conflicts directly with the advice being handed down to each new generation. </p>
<p><strong>Putting the Pieces Together: </strong>One of the main reasons we recommend keeping a basic journal is seeing if your problems and life habits are changing. This was essentially the inspiration for the post. 1) if your general annual calendar isn’t changing this is a bad sign, 2) if your day to day contacts are not changing and item number 1 isn’t changing… this is a second red flag, 3) if you’re trying to squeeze more results out of the same toothpaste tube – a job/career single form of income, it’s not a smart decision, 4) the initial decisions being made today will have an exponential impact on your life 10-years later – it doesn’t matter if you’re 20, 30 or 40 years old, 5) risk isn’t just financial and while leverage is the most common one cited, who you trust with your time and where you place your time is the biggest lever you have, 6) trying to pass down advice only works if you’re up to date on the problems of the generation below you, otherwise it’s just not possible to place the same tired advice that worked 20 years ago onto someone living today and finally 7) spend a lot less time worrying about the growth being 10%, 5% or 15%… focus more on growth being <em>positive</em> a single negative setback or a minus 10%… can negate many years of work. </p>

<p>Not sure how we’d do this as we’ve never been forced to “start over” so it’d Be bad info. The same steps in 20s are same at 30, so really don’t know what the point of the post would be.</p>

<p>“Essentially, it’s hard to blame people for making mistakes when an entire generation (10-20 years older) is pressing them to go into something that no longer works.”</p>
<p>I made tonnes of mistakes because I just didn’t know.</p>
<p>Since I have been reading this blog I have undergone a lot of pain stemming from making changes to my life. Like you said before, once you have been exposed to the truth you can’t live any other way. I tell my girlfriend as if I have been unplugged from the Matrix (societal conditioning &amp; general mediocrity). It stressful and painful to read the blog, gets very heavy, but then the pain passes. </p>
<p>Thanks for exposing the truth.</p>

<p>Contacts changing over time makes sense..It just happens because of the deals &amp; opportunities you pursue, are bigger than years past. Only when you look back is when you realize how much your contacts have changed thru the years.</p>
<p>Also, mentors can be bad per say because what worked for them might not work for you timing wise in the future.  It’s better to have successful contacts, and reach out if you have real CURRENT problems you need another perspective on.</p>

<p>Except in affiliate marketing you can watch that 5-10 year change period switch to significant changes every 2 years in terms of ‘what works’.</p>
<p>For example good luck making $2k per day BH fb/google in 2019 as a beginner…youll need a helluva cloaker</p>

<p>I’m beginning year 3 of “three years and you’re free.”  My life has completely transformed for the better. My career is taking off and my goal is to at least 5X my business in 2019. This sentence rings so true it’s ridiculous “There is something mental/physiological that happens when you realize you will always have some money coming in. It makes your main income producing work improve and at the same time your cash flows will unlikely go into the red any time soon.” 32 years old. Didn’t wake up until 27, for anyone out there that thinks it’s too late, read every post on this blog. Take small, consistent action for three years and see your life transform. Will forever be grateful for stumbling upon this blog. Thanks, WSPs.</p>

<p>Great post, things are a changing from and elder millennial</p>
<p>Coming from the engineering side of the oil and gas industry, working overseas on rigs, tankers, and drill ships the elders would always say, establish residency in a income tax free state, buy a house immediately, start writing off interest and property tax, itemize everything!</p>
<p>Moving forward I’d probably still tell people that work in that field to establish residency in a income tax free state, but don’t buy a primary residence and rent instead (equity is not free money) , buy real estate as an investment if you enjoy flipping houses or being a landlord, money is better invested in a side business or improving a skill set to start a business…don’t overthink the business and fail fast, figure out what went wrong, and start over. Not doing anything is more hurtful then failing and learning to move on. Max out that 401K and matching and plan to roll it over to a Roth IRA when your business picks up momentum and you plan that exit strategy.</p>
<p>Also why are parents still seeking career guidance from a college counselor, wouldn’t it make more sense to ask a CPA or your tax accountant if you want insight as to what career pays well?</p>

<p>Applies to people that use it recklessly. There is a cost associated with refinancing, and equity line of credit is still a loan. If you got the cash flow worked out go for it, if you gamble with equity on your primary residence cause you think you need a vacation or new car, or live beyond your means…well it’s a personal choice.</p>
<p>Especially out here on the west coast 750k home 500k condo average roughly for something just OK, 20% down so you tied up 100k-150k for a primary residence and hope you ride the appreciation trend, it has become a really expensive way to build wealth, plus opportunity cost of having that kind of capital tied up.</p>
<p>This really applies to people that were in a field like mine it didn’t matter where in the country I lived, the company flew me out when it was time to work. So why tie up all capital in a primary residence. There was a time when you got out of school you were already making over 100k, it made sense then to have some itemized deductions, otherwise money just left on the table for the feds, with the new tax law this strategy is not as lucrative. </p>
<p>When you’re young and hungry got to keep light on your feet and be willing to move for better opportunities, money is probably better leveraged through strategies outlined in WSPs book.</p>

<p>The production vs consumption mindset is really interesting. It’s easy to be a consumer, hard to be a producer. One of the biggest mindset changes I have had over the last 5 years, is to stop “consuming” (i.e.  watch TV, eat takeaway food, read ads, study while hoping for job, shopping), and start “producing” (i.e. working out, cooking, selling unnecessary shit). </p>
<p>It has ultimately enabled me to get a job in PE/HF, which I believe are the most rewarding careers (but tough), and taking a silent partner role in a number of ventures. Godspeed.</p>

<p>Geeat post and really love the blog. I am an utter anomaly to this post in many ways, unless I am missing something outside of my extreme after-tax savings rate since college..that’s all the saved me.<br/>
I have had and still have just 1 income stream (outside of investments) with my traditional income as an employee within financial services. I have never made more than $500K annually, but have amassed essentially $2M through saving (6 figs plus annually) for a decent chunk of my first decade out of school and a raging equity bull market. The one thing that I got right is aggressively saving and that was a must especially given my income wasn’t crazy high (NY standards) and I was/am reliant on the same W2 income stream.<br/>
One item to add to WSP…totally agree with the snowball effect regarding saving as early as possible so you have a longer horizon of compounding magic to do its work…All I need is 5%ish on my investments now for my NW growth to exceed my savings etc.<br/>
Also, once you get into your 30’s (at least for me) fighting lifestyle inflation is a bigger challenge. As WSP has said many times, you don’t need nice “stuff” in your 20’s but, now I kind of want to indulge, with that really nice house or car for the first time, esp bc I kind of feel like I made it and now deserve it. Unfortunately, with 2M you can only do so much without beefing up too much on the reoccurring expenses. </p>
<p>On the flipside, I think I have also checked every negative. I still almost exclusively keep in touch with the same guys that I’ve kept in touch with since I was a little kid and with college friends. I would certainly like to meet new contacts, particularly given guys I grew up with and went to college w have less in common with. Living in New York, you would think it would be easier to meet new guys etc. My professional calendar has also not really involved as I have stayed doing some of the same consistent work I have for a decade outside of just some minor tweaks and changes over the years.<br/>
Throughout the 10 years of my working life, I have often watched sports and kind of did what the masses did on my weekends and free time and really only worked 50 to 60 hours a week. I guess I just kind of got lucky in the sense of getting a relatively high paying job and been fortunate with my aggressive saving/investing early on.</p>

<p>Sounds like you went straight frugal monk, made bank, and lived the same lifestyle as your lesser income friends.</p>
<p>If you want to inflate your lifestyle, your not gonna want to count on job security(1 income stream), since robots and AI are coming(here). Millions of finance jobs/accounting will be gone by 2025, millions of jobs in general.</p>
<p>If you had played it right, real estate and income producing assets/business would secure a baseline survival.</p>
<p>Paying cash for 1M house+250k car would be a huge chunk of your savings for little return. If you did it on credit, and got ICED your overhead would eat up your savings and you would be toast.</p>
<p>If your baseline lifestyle is secured without any work at all+ You continue to work/have multiple income streams. Then yes buy whatever you want.</p>
<p>Big house and a new car are worthless<br/>
Get a duplex/quadplex and a used car.</p>

<p>Appreciate the response and your assement is right on for the most part! I def would have been better served building up on the passive income side. However, I have and continue to do a number of private RE deals, which have helped and diversify my asset allocation from exclusively being reliant on equities. My public stock exposure is now down to just 70%. I think my job is relatively (key word) secureish in the sense it’s exclusively relationship based, not to say things can’t change etc.  I also owned rental RE years ago after undergrad and later sold. I would agree about the lifestyle inflation points. I just feel conflicted btwn indulging (as now have a family and want the house) and wanting to do the fiscally responsible choice of buying a multi-family, which isn’t as condusive to family life. So hard to know what’s appropriate moving forward and what’s best lifestyle wise/financially etc.</p>

<p>The physics apply to life section is SO REAL. I am 24 and I see this SO MUCH already.</p>
<p>I know people who were smarter in their decision-making, graduated a year or 2 earlier than me, and just by the effects of compounding, are in a more advanced position than me. </p>
<p>The opposite is also true, I remember many people in college who decided to “get serious and figure shit out” right before senior year. They ended up having to settle for a relatively inferior job, with a significantly lower salary and lower growth prospects. </p>
<p>With that in mind, I am definitely making it a point to invest most of my time and money to building more sources of income now to avoid falling behind.</p>

<p>Money compounds.</p>
<p>Would you say that knowledge also compounds; that your expertise builds on itself?</p>
<p>I’ve seen the phrase ‘compound knowledge’ thrown around a lot.</p>

<p>I want to give my personal example of how true this statement is that you made above in the 6th paragraph: </p>
<p>“There is something mental/physiological that happens when you realise you will always have some money coming in”</p>
<p>With encouragement from my Dad in my 20s, I bought a 3-bed property in my home town in the UK for £127,000 in 2004. I rented it out and moved to Australia to pursue a career in IT Sales because I could see how there was so much money in the mining boom lifting all boats. I’ve never been interested in property but he said to me at the time when I was working as an IT Sales graduate in the UK that I was wasting my wages and I should invest it to rent it out while I was living at home with my parents. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2018 and I’m now 40. The property brings in £720pm rent and is worth £260,000, I have £9K remaining on my mortgage (which I can pay off in about 5 seconds flat with the commission I have earned and saved from my career in Enterprise IT Sales). I am about to quit my job forever and pursue multiple business ideas. Although I have around $160,000 USD in savings, that tiny sum of £720 per month is the mental safety blanket I need to know that even if I fail at all of my business ideas in the next 18-24 months, I will be just fine. I will be doing 3 month stints in Asia, Europe and the US because all I need is internet after I leave Australia. (This place is about to go into a massive recession by the way. Aussies have been lecturing me for years that property only goes up. They are seeing right now that it does not, especially the ones who bought apartments!)</p>
<p>If I had read Efficiency when it did not even exist in my 20s, I would easily have $1m USD by now. </p>
<p>Thanks so much for your amazing content.</p>

<p>Interesting commentary did not know we had readers from Australia as well. Welcome and thank you for the comment!</p>
<p>Also interesting how valuable earning money passively is (online, rentals, dividends) once you realize you’re not locked to a city you now have a better “worst case scenario”. </p>
<p>Your worst case scenario is a good life in a cheap country in Asia. Before passive income, your worst case was working a dead end job (assumes everything hits the fan) saving nothing in a western country. It really is insane how valuable it is.</p>
