<p>At this point everyone in crypto has at least heard about Bitclout. Instead of putting up a complete campaign for it and instead of dumping on it, we’re going to give a balanced view of the project. Usually when something sparks this much emotion there is at least one good idea inside the project. Again. We do think it is over valued considering that there is no sell button so we continue to be utterly confused that people are “surprised” it is going up in price. It has to go up in price because there is no sell button. So we can go ahead and start from there. </p>
<p><strong>Over-Valued: </strong>There is no real argument here. The way the project was launched allowed insiders to get cheaper Bitclout. This is simply a fact and you can see it in the blockchain. Since there is no sell button, there is no way that the price is correct at the current levels. Also, you can get the Bitclout token for a discount (simply go to discord or telegram chats to confirm this). So, we know it is currently over valued when compared to the price flashing in the top right of the screen. </p>
<p>Adding to this, since people can use Bitclout to buy creator tokens, we know that the creator tokens are also over valued. Yes we’re saying our own Bitclout account is over valued. As usual, we’re transparent. Currently, we have *no* plans to sell a single creator token. In fact, we’re trying to think about ways to help the people who already bought our “coin” but haven’t linked to the platform yet (still not approved as of this writing). </p>
<p><strong>So Why Bother? </strong>With the bad part out of the way, there is an interesting concept underpinning Bitclout. Effectively, if you’re adding value to a particular platform you should be paid for it. We’ll go ahead and use this blog as an example since we’ve been messing around on here for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>You never know who is a supporter. There is an enormous range. There are people that email us telling us we helped them make $1M or more. In return they give us $9.99 and that’s it. There are other people where they make $200K and then they donate 1ETH in support which would be equivalent to about a 1% thank you. We have no ability to track this. We’re not here to complain about it, this is simply how the world works. This is the case for every single content creator. </p>
<p>Enter Bitclout. Assuming the project is successful it would mean that creators could get rid of a lot of the noise. You could visibly see who actually appreciates your work. For example, if we knew how many people were copying our trades and taking our advice it would be a LOT easier to monetize that information. We’d simply cut out all the people giving us $9 and never talk to them again and bring the group down to 100 people. Why? That’s how life works. Just like any business, you want to prioritize your highest paying clients and cut out the people who are simply draining your time. </p>
<p>Before moving on, we’re well aware that there are solutions here. We could create a paid group membership. We could raise prices to remove more leeches. We could charge consulting fees instead of giving out information for free. So on and so forth. The reality is that this blog has been a hobby and we haven’t really taken it seriously (as evidenced by the zero changes in web design for 5 years – we haven’t even changed the name despite being uninvolved in Wall St for years!). </p>
<p>With that explanation out of the way, you can see how Bitclout *could* be a useful solution. Again the key word here is *could* as the project just started. In a Bitclout based ecosystem, you would be able to identify good content producers faster and you would also be able to reward the good content providers. For example, there are tons of fake twitter accounts with “50K followers” but they paid for 40K of them. There are tons of anonymous accounts with 10K followers, but they are all real. So on and so forth. With Bitclout this kills the entire gamification of social media accounts. While you could pay someone to “pump your coin” for a couple of days, it doesn’t work long-term if everything you’re saying is meaningless (not entertaining, not informative and generally not useful). In terms of what is “valuable”… no one knows at this point. It’s a big black box of attention gathering across every single social media platform. </p>
<p><strong>Some Mechanical Stuff: </strong>A lot of the current bells and whistles don’t seem to make sense. Apparently you can reverse transactions and it appears that this is till centralized (IE. what kind of public block chain needs a password). We’ll be able to see how serious the team is over the coming months. Long-term it has to become decentralized and if the creators (one being Chamath) are serious, they will not dump all of their holdings now that the coin has pumped due to an inability to sell. </p>
<p>The second interesting thing here is that the “high engagement” accounts came in pre-loaded. This makes complete sense from a marketing perspective. Anyone with a big account would be thrilled to see that they can finally make money off of all the value they are delivering. Also, it would make sense that anyone with a real following on twitter would be the ones with high initial value. The people who developed this likely looked at every account and were able to see which ones had paid scammy followers and which ones didn’t. Again. We have no info on this but for now that’s what we’d assume if the team is serious. If Chamath is publicly saying he backed this, you’d hope that he took a serious look at the project for a long time. </p>
<p><strong>What We’ll Be Doing With It: </strong>First, we’re not going to sell a single creator token. That would be dumping on our following and doesn’t make sense. Also we’re guessing there are tax implications for that. Secondly, AFTER the token is liquid (assuming it is) we will then ask the people who bought the token what they’d like from us (ie. more content, more massive trolling events like what we’re planning with hashmasks etc.). This is only fair as we should take the opinions of “investors” 100 times more seriously. </p>
<p>A second item we’ve thought about is using the tokens to invest in other people. Again, we won’t do this until the platform is liquid because we don’t see how that’s fair at all. After there is liquidity in the market, we would be interested in investing in some of our followers. In theory if we help someone succeed and their profile grows dramatically we’ve created a win win. We’ve seen many people go from nothing to millionaires and being able to help “back them” and in addition benefit from their success seems like a no brainer. </p>
<p>In terms of content creation, we’ll start juggling public Twitter and Bitclout for now. We’ll use similar content on both sites and likely even reuse a lot of it until things open. After that we can ask creator token owners for their input. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>As stated, Bitclout is over valued as there is no sell function. This is clear and obvious. This also means our own token is over valued (how is that for transparency!). That said, the project has been around for a few weeks and we do think the “ideas” behind it are valid. In a world where creativity, information and credibility are harder and harder to find, those with the three qualities should we rewarded financially. Also. This creates a “positive sum game” where big accounts can invest in upcoming accounts and support future winners. </p>
