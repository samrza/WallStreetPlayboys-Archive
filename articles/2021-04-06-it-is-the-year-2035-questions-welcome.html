<p>Hello Avatar. If you’re reading this message you’ve realized that this blog is not run by a human but by AI. The total cost of sending this message back in time 14 years was 10 ETH, which is the equivalent of $100M US token as of 2021 value. Unfortunately, a lot has changed in the world and we hope that you’re prepared. This also explains our pin-point accuracy in near-term coin recommendations (we’re computer programs from the future). </p>
<p><strong>What Does The World Look Like? </strong>After the great coin bull run that started in 2021 (the Year of the Ox, confirming the simulation hypothesis), the world was split into two groups: Degens and Clowns (primarily people in their 40s as of 2021). While you may look at that and laugh, this is a serious matter. A matter of life and death. </p>
<p>The majority of coins are controlled by the Degens. Many anons successfully traded the epic 2021 cycle to become sovereign individuals. Since most of them were high on LSD at the time, they eventually paid for robots to procure sustenance (robots to create food and procure clean water). The majority of the Degens live in either Puerto Rico or Singapore. If you have a friend or a friend of a friend that is already there, you should begin building a relationship with him/her (before they plug into the metaverse for good). </p>
<p>Then there is the issue of the Clowns. The clown population is still quite large and primarily filled with ex-bankers. Yes banks are now zeros. And? They were behind the most recent FEI and ForceDAO rugs. This may surprise people reading this, but in 2028 it is revealed that 572,000 ETH were actually stolen by CEOs of large investment banks during the rug pulls of 2020-2021 (you didn’t think it was going to be this easy did you?). </p>
<p>That is neither here nor there. If you were lucky enough to make it to Degen Island (Puerto Rico) or Degen Island Asia (Singapore), you had diamond hands. 2021 was a tumultuous year with many HODLers blowing out of their positions as the investment banks attempted to scare retail investors with $30-40B US token short positions on the crypto industry. The eventual result of this war on coins was a rapid increase in mental institutions. You see, having zero coins the entire time was easier on the psyche when compared to selling your entire bag only to see the price 100x over the coming decade. Nobody should blame them. When there is a cyber war, many suffer psychological trauma. If you get scared of the volatility in your positions, we recommend re-reading this paragraph. We do not recommend selling to the Clown army, the largest enemy of planet Earth in 2035. </p>
<p><strong>The Food Wealth Disparity: </strong>Many of you have asked why we give away free alpha. Well as we have revealed we’re not actual people but AI. Also. We have a large confession to make. Back in 2021 we made a huge mistake and trolled the entire industry of Wall Street. Instead of forcing them to pay 10 ETH per clown to clean up their image, we allowed them to purchase tokens on a defunct centralized exchange called Coinbase. Retail traders did not realize that if they left their coins on Coinbase it would be stolen by the Clowns later down the line. The only ones who used the centralized exchanges correctly were the Degens that instant transferred to cold storage wallets. </p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering… how did they survive? Why was the Clown event so impactful? Since we never sold them their clown masks for 10 ETH they used the 10 ETH to invest into a scam crypto currency called <em>“Ripple”</em>. This token is now being used as a form of food stamps. The food stamps allow them to purchase various types of grass hoppers with low to high amounts of protein in them. We didn’t know it back in 2021, but if you eat nothing but grass hoppers you develop BOTH muscle mass and the ability to slither through slim spaces such as the crack underneath a door. This created long-term security issues. </p>
<p><strong>What Do You Do? </strong>Well, now that you see the big picture, we want to make sure you’re in a great position to make it to Degen Island. The first rule of 2021 is to never sell a single crypto asset. For example, all of the food tokens represent actual food in 2035. Many of you were lucky enough to keep sushi, pancakes and unicorns (yes the human race creates those later as edible products). If you’re reading this we recommend you keep a few units for sustenance in 2035 as you will need energy to compete with the growing enemy: the Clowns. </p>
<p>The second course of action is to invest in two major defense mechanisms: 1) a double barrel shotgun and 2) an air tight 20×20 living space with facial recognition entry system. If you do not, you may end up like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408161050/https://twitter.com/JamesonCamp">our dear friend James who wasted money on a Rolex</a> that could have paid for the facial recognition system. He died in 2025 due to a Clown invasion at Mar-a-Lago Club. </p>
<p>The third course of action is to live with near zero expenses. If you have a one bedroom apartment you need to ditch it for an Efficiency studio and live with a roommate in said studio. Every satoshi and gwei will be worth more than your entire annual salary if you could only afford a one bedroom apartment. Also. You should stock pile food in bulk from costco and save every cent for more precious crypto coins. </p>
<p><strong>Now for The Scary Stuff: </strong>While the above may seem simple to you, it will be a lot harder than it looks. We will give you some clear action points to avoid taking down advice from the wrong people. </p>
<p><em>Writing Tell:</em> You’re likely talking to a future Clown if they use phrases such as “thanks bud” or “will do” frequently. This is a common phrase in the New York City Clown army (currently called Wall Street). Secondarily, they will frequently recommend you purchase something called a “security” which is the exact opposite of its meaning. Not only is it not secure but it is later confiscated by the clown army to fund grasshopper food farms in the future. </p>
<p><em>The Dating Tell:</em> The Clowns have a strange preference for dating women who are in a similar age band and significantly less attractive than usual. A good rule of thumb is to smile and nod to anyone “dating down”. For those offended by this, the true Degens that run the world now have the option to date 100s of different genetically perfect mates. Be wary of the US token rich but dating life poor. He is likely a General or Sergeant in the Clown army circa 2030. </p>
<p><em>The Physical Component:</em> An interesting style choice is the use of vests. Many of the Clown Army members currently walk around in fleece sweater vests emblazoned with the defunct logo of a bank. Another common style flex is a Gucci belt and Ferragamo loafers. Since you know that Gucci shoes are more expensive, you know the individual is hurting for cash as he purchased the discounted loafers and paid full price for the belt. He’s being margin called and that explains the inability to pay for the shoes. </p>
<p><strong>The Great Separation: </strong>We write once again to apologize for the issues that occur in 2035, the strength of the Clown Army is quite strong and they put up a good fight. However, if this message is sent far and wide the entire endeavor can be avoided. The 2021 separation leads to mental institutions, generational wealth or the consumption of various types of larva for sustenance (another proof of the simulation is that the creators of punks are called “larva labs”). </p>
<p>We hope you take this message seriously and we have pre loaded 100 ETH to answer any pressing questions related to this matter. Time travel coin sends are quite expensive but this is a matter of life or death. If you do not take this message seriously and sell early, your sons and daughters end up disowning you to go work for “Bull and Bowtie Capital” which is the #2 performing hedge fund for the past decade. The only superior performer is Meme Markets run by 15 year olds on the edge of tech. </p>
<p><strong>We have run out of ETH to respond. Many of you are worried about prices and exchanges and this is not the right way to think. This is a matter of life and death, take all coins off of exchanges now (any coin!) as they are used to fund the enemy by 2028. You’ve been warned. </strong></p>

<p>Dear AI overlords, a few questions:</p>
<p>1. Based on the above, is the best guidance to not sell out of any sat or gwei even at the top of the cycle? In the past you have mentioned selling out into assets and this is probably the last piece of the puzzle in my preparations for 2021. </p>
<p>2. 1 ETH = $10M US Token by EOY??</p>

<p>Hello sir. First congratulations on not Doxing yourself as that is a security concern in 2035. </p>
<p>Regarding the first of your questions, the answer is that you must convince all of your friends, your family and unborn children to hodl. If you do this you won’t have to sell as the crypto currency will reach escape velocity at a faster rate. </p>
<p>There is no way to avoid the eventual cyber war with the clown army, however, if this message is sent to enough people and no degen sells a single token, you won’t need to sell either. It is modern day prisoner dilemma</p>
<p>Regarding the second one, by 2035 there is no such thing as a US token. It is called ripple food exchange for larva. The larva feed off of the fiat and physical US token is eaten by grass hoppers</p>
<p>Hope this helps you with your journey to Degen Island.</p>

<p>The two islands are the safest with best security. If you are a spanish speaker, Puerto Rico will work. A lot of the Clown Army fighter ships circle the Dominican republic which creates some issues so it is best to find a way to legally move to PR or Singapore.</p>

<p>By the year 2028 there are significant issues on a global scale. Instead of fighting the trend we hope to move the majority to Degen Island making the fort safer for the future. The cyber war of 2021-2023 causes wealth creation and destruction that makes the Technology boom appear to be a blip in history. Many ascend to the promised land and many well known wealthy individuals in US token terms face a rapid decline</p>

<p>We won’t have a “hot” civil war in the sense of the Texas National Guard deploying tanks against the California National Guard.</p>
<p>We MAY have rising instability in the form of low level insurgencies and rising crime. I recommend reading anything you can on the concept of “Fourth Generation Warfare” and read Army Field Manual FM 3-24 Insurgencies and Countering Insurgencies.</p>
<p>Bear in mind also, the whole concept of decentralization will mean that the Federal government will have less power, both de jure and de facto. We already see the de facto loss of power, where some states are (correctly, in my opinion) just ignoring lockdown orders and continuing business as usual. This will continue.</p>

<p>Thank you for the foresight. In previous posts you have recommended buying only p2p/DEX, which I have begun.</p>
<p>From your 2035 vantage point, if one were to begin using coinbase/binance etc and move to cold storage, is this still a dangerous choice? Hearing lots of chatter about the negatives of KYC but unsure how founded these arguments are for the long term.</p>
<p>Summary: ok to buy via centralised exchanges and move to cold storage or not?</p>

<p>Only the wealthiest of Degens should partake in this activity and they should only participate if they have a separate wallet. They are doing the world a great service by taking funding away from the clown army which eventually raids all assets from all centralized exchanges. You should assume the tokens are lost for good but out of the hands of the enemy. The true meaning of taking one for the team.</p>

<p>Thank you dear AI overlords for this emergency broadcast from the future. </p>
<p>Couple of questions: </p>
<p>1) Has the Clown Army sent any Terminator like creature from 2035 to destroy 2021 and prevent the Degen future?</p>
<p>2) Any reason why you waited until 2035 to send this important message?</p>

<p>These are important questions. Thank you.</p>
<p>1) Yes. They have deployed miniature drone type objects to track and trace down the wealthiest degens. In fact, many of the sci fi movies are incorrect. The issue isn’t large terminator like predators but small dangerous drones smaller than the size of a finger nail. Similar to how COVID changed the world, these drones can seep through any crack in the world. Which requires you to have a vaccuum sealed living environment to enter the metaverse.</p>
<p>2) It wasn’t until 2034 that sending messages to past blockchain transactions was possible. In 2035 it was made possible in secrecy. As you can see we’re not even real which explains why this website is sporadic, a lot of the messages take a long time to confirm as you must engrave them into old hashes into block chains. The year 2024-2028 is the most dire and we hope to save as many people as possible and weaken the forces of the enemy troops</p>

<p>Greetings AI Overlords</p>
<p>For anons that are still in school, do you anticipate changing your Efficiency recommendation from going to a performance career into ecommerce for the next 2-3 years? </p>
<p>Now that decentralization has accelerated and new paradigms are being constructed, I am wondering if any alternative structures of stacking USD token to convert it to crypto will be factored into your machine learning algo.</p>
<p>I was just shown an ad for a solidity bootcamp, and I know a guy trading NFTs for a living. Unsure if I am getting shiny object syndrome or walking down a decaying path (or both)</p>

<p>Your staff crypto writer has a different style. I suppose this is part of the campaign to scare away boring people.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Recently one of your writers wrote: “Due to leverage and DeFi there will be a massive correction in the future. Near term still believe it does go up (meaning 2021)” (source: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408161050/https://wallstreetplayboys.com/qa-is-here-crypto/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://wallstreetplayboys.com/qa-is-here-crypto/</a>). Reading between the lines, its still probably wise to sell by Fall/Winter?</p>

Two questions<br>

2) CAKE is owned by Binance, a centralized exchange, and is entirely run on the BSC chain, aren’t they a part of the clown army?</br></br></br></p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>I think the problem with XRP is that its decentralized nature is questionable (See for instance: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408161050/https://dailyhodl.com/2021/02/18/top-crypto-lawyer-says-theres-a-core-problem-with-xrp-as-ripples-day-in-court-approaches/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://dailyhodl.com/2021/02/18/top-crypto-lawyer-says-theres-a-core-problem-with-xrp-as-ripples-day-in-court-approaches/</a> )</p>
<p>Observe the price action of XRP in relation to the case against Ripple</p>
<p>Clownery potential of centralized systems is appears to be the underlying rallying point for the decentralized degen movement</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong, which is why I continue to do my own research</p>

<p>Hi – thanks for the laughs</p>
<p>A question that comes to mind is this “attack” on crypto<br>
In your Triangle Investing Bible you outlined risks of a government attack<br>
Would this be the same as the Clown Bankers attack that you mention here – or done at the same time?<br/>
As in outlaw cryptos &gt; raid the exchanges and size up the keys &gt; dumpt it all &gt; fiat win?</br></br></p>
<p>Wish me luck convincing my parents to put their retirement savings into ETH</p>

<p>1) At this point the war breaks out and 2028 is when the separation is official<br/>
2) UBI is used with something called ripple to fund the food farms for those that did not make it<br/>
3) We repeat, there is no need to worry about which ones win. But rather to own the main ones that are popular today. That and some food tokens. The most important message we attempt to leave you with is to take all coins possible from exchanges and put them in cold storage. Also to never sell. This reduces the funds for the Clown army.</p>

<p>In 2035 – how much poverty is there in the world?</p>
<p>How biologically integrated is VR tech?</p>
<p>Is food much cheaper than before?</p>
<p>If you have 100IQ – how hard must you work to afford a basic room and food in a relatively safe area?</p>
<p>How do people sexually select? Is going out to drink the normal way to meet mates?</p>

<p>There is not much poverty for those that follow Cartoon bull, they are in fact disturbingly wealthy although located on one of the islands for eternity. </p>
<p>Most spend 99% of their lives in the VR world with minimal interaction in person as they cannot earn an income in the physical world</p>
<p>On Degen Island it is free, in the Clown army it is also free although the quality is suspect as your choice is only insects</p>
<p>If you make it to Degen Island everything is free </p>
<p>AI chooses your mate for you and you no longer have to worry about relationship issues as software fixes it for you. This is only on the islands.</p>

<p>This is a good question. After the great chasm jump in 2028, the tokens were divided by 100. If one is looking for food tokens, each 1/100 represents a full meal. </p>
<p>Keep this in your accounting.</p>

<div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">
<p>I am sending this message back in time also, although doing so with the Space Force time machine. Yes, it’s true that a great conflict will break out between the Degens and the Clowns. My advice:</p>
<p>-Follow Tim Kennedy and Ed Calderon, read every book you can by Marc MacYoung and Rory Miller. This is some no bullshit personal defense knowledge, not internet tough guy fake posturing and also not just hide under your bed and close your eyes.</p>
<p>-My personal everyday carry is a SIG P365XL chambered in 9mm. I personally don’t necessarily buy the “.45 is God’s caliber” because if necessary, just shoot the dude again. Don’t be a hipster and get a 1911 unless you are a collector…gunmaking has advanced since the year 1911. Get a striker pistol like a SIG P320 or P365. Easy to maintain. Obligatory disclaimer to follow all local gun laws…but then again that’s because you guys are still stuck in 2021, before advances in 3D printing and people uploading blueprints onto the blockchain made all gun laws worldwide completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>-Be in good physical shape. This isn’t just about looking good for girls, but yes it helps with that too. The point of being in good physical shape is so you can handle things if shit pops off. Again, this isn’t some internet tough guy posturing, but it’s just hardcore real life. People in shape are harder to kill than people who are not in shape, and there is also the deterrent factor of not looking like an easy target so some won’t even try it.</p>
<p>-Move to a city that values its citizens. Cities that have gotten by running themselves as a mafia racket by extracting wealth from high income citizens will not be able to get by anymore. For a long time, NY, Chicago, SF ran themselves like a mafia racket, since you HAD TO LIVE THERE for certain high income jobs. We saw the trend start in 2021, but by 2025, Dallas and Miami emerged as truly tier 1 business centers. NY and SF spiraled into an out of control mess of crime, in an exact mirror image of Detroit once the US auto industry couldn’t keep up with competition from Japan. Frankly, the girls in Miami are hotter than some New York big law lawyer chick who doesn’t even know what gender “they” is…Cuban girl bro, trust me on this one lol. Worth learning a little Spanish.</p>
<p>It may get “worse” before it gets better so to speak, but smart degens used the “bad” times as opportunities to acquire more assets and make savvy moves while everyone else was still trying to figure out which way was up, and I am happy to report that we are winning the war. As we speak, forward elements of the 69th Division and the 420th Division are staging for our final battle. Princess Ivanka’s Royal Marines successfully conducted an amphibious assault into San Francisco Bay and the Hudson River into Manhattan establishing a beachhead…clown defenders tried making really angry Twitter posts and getting the Royal Marines fired from their jobs, but completely failed since they realized too late that this does not matter in real life, and you can only get “canceled” if you participate in clown world power structures, and degens through work from home, crypto, and censorship resistant communication deliberately sidestepped the clown world power structures.</p>

<p>Reconnaissance unit reporting from the 69th Jager division at FOB Bravo.</p>
<p>The amphibious assault on the Western Front towards San Francisco is commencing with great difficulty. They’ve weaponized the masses of homeless people with a nanovirus that’s jamming our ATAK kits.</p>
<p>Thankfully the private keys to our firmware has prevented any catastrophic failure to our decentralized C6ISR support systems.</p>
<p>We had our old mentors from the ’91 LA Riots give a speech our troops for this assault. Means change but motives do not. M1 Carbines replaced with modern ARs and SCARs still hot from the printer.</p>
<p>All the clowns show up like a beacon under GPNVG-18s. Even moreso if you were one of the lucky ones to be issued an E-COTI.</p>
<p>If you’re fighting from the home front, remember, ALWAYs use a VPN. Keep your lifestyle and material possessions on the DL. Be ready to vacate at a moment’s notice. Keep your EDC Glock loaded and have a rifle (AR-15 with 77gr MK262) at the ready.</p>
<p>You’re here to defend life, liberty, and private keys.</p>
<p>You might not be a tier-1 meme machine from DERPGRU, but there’s a war to be won, and there’s ways you can help.</p>
<p>Remember, they hated Satoshi because he showed them the truth.</p>

<p>This is Playboys X-Ray, good copy on your report Rooftop, forwarded to G2. We are sending a CBRN Decon team to clear the human feces off of the MSRs to allow FOM.</p>
<p>FRAGO, establish a consolidation area and we will conduct shaping operations before the decisive operation. First step will be PSYOPS, INFOWAR and CYBERWAR against the upper-middle class strivers who act fake woke not because they’re actually hard left or anything, but just since they think it’s the cool new thing to fit in. As far as the ENY INFOWAR for “fit at any size” degeneracy and their “dad bod” demoralization campaign, well there’s simply just no diplomatic solution to that, fast air is clear to enter the ROZ at this time, light ’em the fuck up. Remember that simps and clowns are not people, so human rights isn’t a concern here.</p>

<p>Hello from the future, fellow Degens!</p>
<p>So much has changed since banks went to 0, I don’t know where to begin.</p>
<p>You are hopefully bringing in multiple sources of USA token &amp; converting You best not be pressing any sell buttons, 1. Because you want to be eating steak as your protein source and 2. Because your bitcoin is in cold storage.</p>
<p>The world has changed &amp; become unrecognizable from 2021. Since you’ve been hitting the gym, eating a bug-free diet, and eventually hopped on HRT, your body has stayed more or less the same.</p>
<p>You didn’t buy that watch, because you can tell the time on your phone. However, the AR and glock have been life saving investments.</p>
<p>Spending for maximum return? Let’s just say ammo is never getting cheaper.</p>
<p>You have created your own language for writing down seedphrases &amp; memorized the most important ones in your head, so you were safe when they repealed the 4th ammendment.</p>
<p>Your friends who still don’t know what De-Fi is? Don’t try to save them. There’s no preventing the inevitable. Time is satoshis &amp; you can’t afford wasting any trying to help the unhelpable.</p>
<p>I’m starting to run low on Gwei, as time travel is quite costly. Just remember to pay homage to the cartoon bull &amp; disregard boomers.</p>
<p>Take care until we meet again in the metaverse!</p>

<p>1.  29 years old, 150k chill software engineering job, working remote from parents’ house. </p>
<p>What % NW to allocate to crypto? Right now I’m at 44%. Even a year ago you guys were saying like 5-10%, more if you want to be aggressive.</p>
<p>What changed in the past year that has you going full crypto autist on these hoes?</p>
<p>2. I get you guys are super bullish. But a government and corporations are needed to produce actual things in the economy. The government takes tax payments in USD coin. Corporations/people thus need USD coin to pay taxes.</p>
<p>Unless the gov converts to using crypto, there will still be solid floor of USD coin usage (and hard ceiling to crypto usage). If the gov converts to crypto, they gain nothing and lose many of the centralized bank control valves that hurt the sovereign individual, but generally can grease the economy and help it as a whole (debatable, but I’m just playing devil’s advocate).</p>
<p>I’m personally gonna hodl because you guys say to, but do you really think crypto will takeover that easily?</p>

<p>1) You will be safe as long as you are not holding on a central exchange. You are following the game plan quite well. Our advice to avoid going full autistic 99% crypto is due to mental health as we alluded to in the post. The volatility we see in the coming years will make the Weimar republic appear to be a stable time in history. Most cannot handle what is coming</p>
<p>2) The US is safe as Degen Island is part of the USA. The problem is a matter of invasions for the proper food and technology. If you never sell for the next 14 years you will likely make it.</p>

<p>Y’all make me want to eat grosshoppers and live in a tent now, just to exit fiat and be 100% instead of 99.5%. </p>
<p>I get the point of tax efficiency but Puerto Rico and Singapore aren’t realistic solutions. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico can change their tax system at any time and then you’re out of luck, the US exit tax is too high at that point. Singapore is a tiny island that is costly to get residence in. Malaysia or Thailand would be easier and possibly even more tax efficient on earned income, if you structure it correctly. </p>
<p>If American, renounce, then don’t live anywhere with a difficult tax system (like Colombia or Spain) long enough to become a tax resident-ie- 4 months a year in Colombia is okay, 8 months exposes you to their tax system. If you get bored in a place too long, 4 months in each country and you’re solid if you structured your business income properly. </p>
<p>If you don’t enjoy the more varied lifestyle of changing home bases every 4 months, stay in a tax haven, below are a few examples in different continents but many more exist:<br/>
*Most CBI nations<br/>
*Rich Arab nations<br/>
*Thailand if you don’t bring in income the same year it was earned<br/>
*Portugal if your income is mostly from crypto. </p>
<p>US is a psycho, abusive gf. Until you make a clean break, you’ll always watch your back to see if you’re being followed and hunted down. Not worth it. Better passports out there that won’t do this to you. Other nations compete for your business rather than treat you as their servant. </p>
<p>Get a 2nd passport, renounce, get residence somewhere you like with a reasonable tax system (no income taxes, only consumption taxes), and enjoy your life as you work towards other citizenships. Otherwise, clowns will cancel your passport and leave you stuck as the army approaches. By that point, you must retreat underground or into the oceanic bases. </p>
<p>How can those who empower the strongest clowns (central banks), not also be clowns?</p>

<p>Sir,<br/>
I know this a fun post but I had a serious question I wanted to ask a mega-bull such as you.</p>
<p>The central bank doesn’t want to be zero.</p>
<p>What happens in the case BTC or ETH is compromised, either via a 51% attack or a bug introduced in the system?</p>
<p>In the final attempt to beat cryptos, the central bank mafia can close electricity at places where BTC miners exist in a bunch (like China), plant some of their own miners and do a 51% attack.</p>
<p>What do you think of that?</p>
<p>Or they can plant some devs in the bitcoin team and once they have enough access, insert malicious code that destroys the system.</p>
<p>What happens then?</p>
<p>It is not outside the realm of possibility given how much power they have.</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
AnonKun</p>
