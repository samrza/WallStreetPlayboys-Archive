# WSP Archive - Preserving Timeless Wisdom  

This project is an archive of **WallStreetPlayboys (WSP)** articles—some of the most valuable insights ever written on business, life efficiency, and discipline.  

Since their original content was removed, I’ve put together this site to make sure their lessons remain accessible for those who want to maximize their potential.  

### What's Inside?  
- A **simple, 90s-style static site** (no distractions, just content).  
- All WSP articles, **organized by date and title**.  
- A **GIF background** for a nostalgic touch.  

### Why This Exists?  
Because **great knowledge shouldn’t be lost**. If WSP impacted you, this archive is here to keep their wisdom alive.
